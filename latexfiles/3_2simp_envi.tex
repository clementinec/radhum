%Cooling Energy Savings Potential
The energy savings that can be achieved through improved set points is primarily from the variations of enthalpy differences, which represents the total energy that needs to be delivered by the HVAC systems. This can be further compared through the comparison of the differences between the cooling degree days calculated through the weather files. The total energy demand (sensible and latent) comapred with the sensible load only will not only provide us an estimation of the breakdown of the total energy demand, but also how these numbers vary by states and/or climate zones. 

The results we obtained for the by-state comparison are listed as the following box plot.
