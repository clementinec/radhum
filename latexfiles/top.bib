	abstract = {The cooling degree days ({CDD}) method has widely been used for predicting the cooling energy consumption of buildings with air conditioning. The conventional {CDD} values primarily are based on outdoor dry-bulb temperatures that neglect the influence of latent heat on the total energy load. This study proposes an enthalpy-based {CDD} method to account for latent heat as well as sensible heat. Two institutional buildings were used to examine the applicability and accuracy of the proposed enthalpy-based {CDD}, as compared to the conventional temperature-based {CDD}. To achieve this examination, multiple linear regression analyses were first performed to determine the base temperature/enthalpy points for each building during the different data periods (weekdays, weekends, and all week). Next, the {CDD} values were separately calculated using the determined base temperature/enthalpy points, and linear regression models were developed to predict the cooling energy use. Each individually-predicted cooling energy use employing the temperature- and enthalpy-based {CDD} methods was then compared to the measured cooling energy use. As a result, the comparison utilizing the enthalpy-based {CDD} method resulted in a percent error of approximately 2\% less than that of the temperature-based {CDD} method.},

	abstract = {Climate warming and increasing variability challenges the electricity supply in warm seasons. A good quantitative representation of the relationship between warm-season electricity consumption and weather condition provides necessary information for long-term electricity planning and short-term electricity management. In this study, an extended version of cooling degree days ({ECDD}) is proposed for better characterisation of this relationship. The {ECDD} includes temperature, residual temperature and specific humidity effects. The residual temperature is introduced for the first time to reflect the building thermal inertia effect on electricity consumption. The study is based on the electricity consumption data of four multiple-street city blocks and three office buildings. It is found that the residual temperature effect is about 20\% of the current-day temperature effect at the block scale, and increases with a large variation at the building scale. Investigation of this residual temperature effect provides insight to the influence of building designs and structures on electricity consumption. The specific humidity effect appears to be more important at the building scale than at the block scale. A building with high energy performance does not necessarily have low specific humidity dependence. The new {ECDD} better reflects the weather dependence of electricity consumption than the conventional {CDD} method.},

The main problem with applying this method is that it disregards latent cooling loads. This paper deals with an approach for monitoring electric energy consumption due to cooling in buildings based on cooling degree days, which allows an estimation of latent loads. In addition to applying methods for determining base temperature to base humidity, a new technique is introduced, which is based on a significance test of the enthalpy latent days partial regression coefficient. Analogous to the performance line concept, the influence of latent loads can be presented in the form of a “performance surface” graph. The performance surface is a plot of electric energy consumption as a function of cooling degree days and latent enthalpy days. The above methods are tested on data sets consisting of electric energy consumption data obtained from two buildings and hourly meteorological data.},

	abstract = {In cases where a quick insight into the operation of an {HVAC} system is more important than accuracy, cooling degree days can be used for monitoring electric energy consumption dependent on meteorological conditions. Cooling degree days are calculated from differences between outdoor temperatures above the base temperature and the base temperature itself, therefore containing both climate and building information. The difficulties in applying this method are the determination of base temperature and choosing a procedure for calculating degree days, which vary depending on the resolution of the weather data used. In addition, the cooling degree method has a major flaw, i.e. it considers only a linear dependence between cooling energy consumption and sensible cooling load, thereby ignoring latent loads, which become more significant at higher outdoor temperatures. In this article an analysis of real electric energy consumption data using the cooling degree method and an improved method derived from it that includes latent loads, as well as a comparison between them, are shown. Both methods are applied several times to metered data, each time with a different combination of a method for determining base temperature and a degree day calculation technique.},

	abstract = {The existing building stock in European countries accounts for over 40\% of final energy consumption in the European Union ({EU}) member states, of which residential use represents 63\% of total energy consumption in the buildings sector. Consequently, an increase of building energy performance can constitute an important instrument in the efforts to alleviate the {EU} energy import dependency (currently at about 48\%) and comply with the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is also in accordance to the European Directive ({EPBD} 2002/91/{EC}) on the energy performance of buildings, which is currently under consideration in all {EU} member states. This paper presents an overview of the {EU} residential building stock and focuses on the Hellenic buildings. It elaborates the methodology used to determine the priorities for energy conservation measures ({ECMs}) in Hellenic residential buildings to reduce the environmental impact from {CO}2 emissions, through the implementation of a realistic and effective national action plan. A major obstacle that had to overcome was the need to make suitable assumptions for missing detailed primary data. Accordingly, a qualitative and quantitative assessment of scattered national data resulted to a realistic assessment of the existing residential building stock and energy consumption. This is the first time that this kind of aggregate data is presented on a national level. Different energy conservation scenarios and their impact on the reduction of {CO}2 emissions were evaluated. Accordingly, the most effective {ECMs} are the insulation of external walls (33–60\% energy savings), weather proofing of openings (16–21\%), the installation of double-glazed windows (14–20\%), the regular maintenance of central heating boilers (10–12\%), and the installation of solar collectors for sanitary hot water production (50–80\%).},

	isbn = {978-1-56898-880-1},
	abstract = {Departing from the simple question Why do we heat and cool buildings with air?, this book focuses on the technique of thermally active surfaces. This technique uses water in building surfaces to heat and cool bodies - a method that is at once more efficient, comfortable, and healthy. This technique thus imbues the fabric of the building with a more poignant role: its structure is also its primary heating and cooling system. In doing so, this approach triggers a cascading set of possibilities for how well buildings are built, how well they perform, and how long they will last: pointing the way toward multiple forms of sustainability. The first section of the book contrasts the parallel histories of thermally active surfaces and air conditioning. These histories explain the material, social, marketing, and technical unfolding of building technology in the twentieth century as a means to explain why we build the way we do and why that will change in the new century. The next section of the book covers the physiological and thermodynamic basis of thermally active surfaces. This section is designed for engineers and architects to grasp the logic and advantages of this technique. This section also includes a chapter on the de-fragmentation of buildings and design practice that is inherent in building with thermally active surfaces. The final section covers a series of contemporary case studies that demonstrate the efficacy of this technique. The project list currently includes Kunsthaus in Bregenz by Peter Zumthor, Zollverein School of Management in Essen, Germany by {SANAA}, and Linked Hybrid in Beijing by Steven Holl, amongst others.},

These include: (1) building performance simulation ({BPS}), (2) physical measurements (in laboratory test chambers and in buildings) and (3) human subject testing/occupant based surveys. This review identified eight conclusive studies: five studies that could not establish a thermal comfort preference between all-air and radiant systems and three studies showing a preference for radiant systems. Very few studies were based on occupant feedback in real buildings suggesting a significant research need. Overall, we found that a limited number of studies are available and therefore a solid answer cannot be given.

In some industrial processes it is desirable to be able to control temperature and relative humidity independently and accurately. When the controller does not take into account the coupling dynamics between these variables, it is impossible to set one without affecting the other, therefore the importance of decoupling techniques to achieve accurate control. We demonstrate how decoupled control of temperature and relative humidity is possible using a multivariable cascade control with two loops. The inner-loop is the noninteracting control law used for decoupling, and the outer-loop is a {PD} controller used for stabilization and control. Simulations are presented at the end of the paper in order to validate the theoretical results.},

The study uses thermodynamic and psychometric analyses, to incorporate the effect of changing {RH} along with the dry bulb temperature on human comfort. Specifically, the study computes the effect of changing the relative humidity on the amount of heat rejected from the passenger compartment and the effect of relative humidity on occupants comfort zone. A practical system implementation is also discussed in terms of an evaporative cooler design. The results show that changing the {RH} along with dry bulb temperature inside vehicular cabins can improve the air conditioning efficiency by reducing the heat removed while improving the Human comfort sensations as measured by the Predicted Mean Value {PMV} and the Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied {PPD} indices.},

	abstract = {Climate control for protected crops brings the added dimension of a biological system into a physical system control situation. The plants in a greenhouse impose their own needs, significantly affect their ambient conditions in a nonlinear way, and add long-time constants to the system response. Moreover, the thermally dynamic nature of a greenhouse suggests that disturbance attenuation (load control of external temperature, humidity, and sunlight) is far more important than is the case for controlling other types of buildings. This paper presents a feedback–feedforward approach to system linearization and decoupling for climate control of greenhouses and more specifically for the operation of ventilation/cooling and moisturizing. The proposed method consists of three parts: (a) a model-based feedback–feedforward compensation of external disturbances (loads) on the basis of input–output linearization and decoupling; (b) the transformation of user-defined desired settings for temperature and humidity into feasible controller setpoints, taking into account the constraints imposed by the capacities of the actuators and the psychrometric laws; and (c) additional {PI} outer loops to compensate for model uncertainties and deviations from expected disturbances (weather). Moreover, some tuning tests lump together several physical system parameters to be easily identified, and the method guarantees accuracy in setpoint tracking while simplifying stability issues. The proposed method is applicable to any air-conditioning system and is expected to gain wide acceptance in modern climate control systems.},

In buildings with air-conditioning, a change in enthalpy between the streams of exhaust and supply air equals the thermal energy per unit of mass needed for the processes of heating, cooling, and humidification. We define Daily Enthalpy Gradients ({DEG}) as the daily average difference in enthalpy from a base temperature or base humidity. This base state of temperature and humidity is a threshold below (or above) which air-conditioning systems do not need to operate to satisfy a state of indoor thermal comfort. In this publication, we suggest that Daily Enthalpy Gradients are useful to understand changes in the specific thermal energy demands of buildings across cities and regions due to climate change.},

Rhino/Grasshopper is one of the most widely used platforms that are used by designers today. There are already a number of environmental plugins developed for Rhino/Grasshopper. However, Ladybug offers several advantages that are currently not offered by existing Rhino/Grasshopper related environmental design plugins. Ladybug imports standard {EnergyPlus} Weather files (.{EPW}) in Grasshopper and provides a variety of 2D and 3D designer-friendly interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the initial stages of design. It also simplifies the process of analysis, automates and expedites the calculations, and provides easy to understand graphical visualizations in the 3D modeling interface of Rhino/Grasshopper. It also allows users to work with validated energy and daylighting engines such as {EnergyPlus}, Radiance and Daysim. Integration with the parametric tools of grasshopper allows for almost instantaneous feedback on design modifications, and as it runs within the design environment, the information and analysis is interactive. The development is a free and open source; users can customize the tool based on their needs and contribute to the source code.Copyright},

	abstract = {The most important meteorological parameter affecting the human energy balance during sunny weather conditions is the mean radiant temperature Tmrt. It considers the uniform temperature of a surrounding surface giving off blackbody radiation, which results in the same energy gain of a human body given the prevailing radiation fluxes. This energy gain usually varies considerably in open space conditions. In this paper, the model ‘{RayMan}’, used for the calculation of short- and long-wave radiation fluxes on the human body, is presented. The model, which takes complex urban structures into account, is suitable for several applications in urban areas such as urban planning and street design. The final output of the model is, however, the calculated Tmrt, which is required in the human energy balance model, and thus also for the assessment of the urban bioclimate, with the use of thermal indices such as predicted mean vote ({PMV}), physiologically equivalent temperature ({PET}) and standard effective temperature ({SET}*). The model has been developed based on the German {VDI}-Guidelines 3789, Part {II} (environmental meteorology, interactions between atmosphere and surfaces; calculation of short- and long-wave radiation) and {VDI}-3787 (environmental meteorology, methods for the human-biometeorological evaluation of climate and air quality for urban and regional planning. Part I: climate). The validation of the results of the {RayMan} model agrees with similar results obtained from experimental studies.},

Thermal comfort researchers and urban planners need easy and sound methodological approaches to assess Tmrt. After the basics of the Tmrt calculation some of the methods suitable for obtaining Tmrt also in urban environments will be presented.. Two of the discussed methods are based on instruments which measure the radiation fluxes integral (globe thermometer, pyranometer-pyrgeometer combination), and three of the methods are based on modelling the radiation environment with {PC} software ({RayMan}, {ENVI}-met and {SOLWEIG}).},

It can seriously affect the productivity and the health of the individual and diminish tolerance to other environmental hazards. However, the assessment of the thermal stress and the translation of the stress in terms of physiological and psychological strain is complex. For over a century attempts have been made to construct an index, which will describe heat stress satisfactorily. The many indices that have been suggested can be categorized into one of three groups: "rational indices", "empirical indices", or "direct indices". The first 2 groups are sophisticated indices, which integrate environmental and physiological variables; they are difficult to calculate and are not feasible for daily use. The latter group comprises of simple indices, which are based on the measurement of basic environmental variables. In this group 2 indices are in use for over four decades: the "wet-bulb globe temperature" ({WBGT}) index and the "discomfort index" ({DI}). The following review summarizes the current knowledge on thermal indices and their correlates to thermal sensation and comfort. With the present knowledge it is suggested to adopt the {DI} as a universal heat stress index.},

In numerous chamber experiments, physiological parameters were adopted to assess thermal comfort, but the experiments' conclusions may not represent a realistic thermal environment due to the highly controlled thermal environment and few occupants. This paper focuses on determining the relationships between upper extremity skin temperatures (i.e., finger, wrist, hand and forearm) and the indoor thermal comfort. Also, the applicability of predicting thermal comfort by using upper extremity skin temperatures was explored. Field studies were performed in office buildings equipped with split air-conditioning ({SAC}) located in the hot summer and cold winter ({HSCW}) climate zone of China during the summer of 2016. Psychological responses of occupants were recorded and physical and physiological factors were measured simultaneously. Standard effective temperature ({SET}*) was used to incorporate the effect of humidity and air velocity on thermal comfort. The results indicate that upper extremity skin temperatures are good indicators for predicting thermal sensation, and could be used to assess the thermal comfort in terms of physiological mechanism. In addition, the neutral temperature was 24.7 °C and the upper limit for 80\% acceptability was 28.2 °C in {SET}*.},

The adaptive approach to modeling thermal comfort acknowledges that thermal perception in ‘real world’ settings is influenced by the complexities of past thermal history and cultural and technical practices. An important premise of the adaptive model is that the person is no longer a passive recipient of the given thermal environment, but instead is an active agent interacting with the person—environment system via multiple feedback loops. Thermal adaptation can be attributed to three different processes—behavioral adjustment, physiological acclimatization and psychological habituation or expectation. Both climate chamber and field evidence indicates that the slower process of acclimatization is not so relevant to thermal adaptation in the relatively moderate conditions found in buildings, whereas behavioral adjustment and expectation have a much greater influence. One of the most important findings from our review of field evidence was the distinction between thermal comfort responses in air-conditioned vs. naturally ventilated buildings, most likely resulting from a combination of past thermal history in the buildings and differences in levels of perceived control.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort is determined by the combined effect of the six thermal comfort parameters: temperature, air moisture content, thermal radiation, air relative velocity, personal activity and clothing level as formulated by Fanger through his double heat balance equations. In conventional air conditioning systems, air temperature is the parameter that is normally controlled whilst others are assumed to have values within the specified ranges at the design stage. In Fanger’s double heat balance equation, thermal radiation factor appears as the mean radiant temperature ({MRT}), however, its impact on thermal comfort is often ignored. This paper discusses the impacts of the thermal radiation field which takes the forms of mean radiant temperature and radiation asymmetry on thermal comfort, building energy consumption and air-conditioning control. Several conditions and applications in which the effects of mean radiant temperature and radiation asymmetry cannot be ignored are discussed. Several misinterpretations that arise from the formula relating mean radiant temperature and the operative temperature are highlighted, coupled with a discussion on the lack of reliable and affordable devices that measure this parameter. The usefulness of the concept of the operative temperature as a measure of combined effect of mean radiant and air temperatures on occupant’s thermal comfort is critically questioned, especially in relation to the control strategy based on this derived parameter. Examples of systems which deliver comfort using thermal radiation are presented. Finally, the paper presents various options that need to be considered in the efforts to mitigate the impacts of the thermal radiant field on the occupants’ thermal comfort and building energy consumption.},

This paper investigates the simplification of past studies that the Tmrt is equal to the air temperature (Ta) under indoor conditions. In a second step, the causes for deviations between the two parameters are examined and integrated into the context of indoor climate. Measurements were conducted in four rooms at the Geography Department of Humboldt University in Berlin during autochthonal weather conditions from the 16th of August to the 2nd of September 2013. Tmrt was derived using integral radiation measurements and three different types of globe thermometers. The study indicates that the deviations between the different methods of obtaining Tmrt are negligible for indoor environments. The results show that the differences between Ta and Tmrt are negligible during most periods, as stated in previous literature. As air temperatures increase, however, Tmrt exceeds Ta up to 1.3 K. The examination of the surface temperatures indicates that rooms with window walls facing southeast and southwest show the largest disparities between Ta and Tmrt. The correlation between Ta and Tmrt and the sum of the short and long wave radiation specifies the radiation intensity and duration as the main driver of Tmrt. Future studies on indoor heat stress should hence consider that Tmrt and Ta can differ depending on the characteristics of the room and on solar radiation.},

	abstract = {The mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is one of the most important meteorological parameters governing human energy balance. In this paper, three different methods of obtaining the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting are compared. Method A is based on integral radiation measurements and angular factors, method B is based on measurements with a 38-mm flat grey globe thermometer and in method C makes use of the Rayman 1.2 software is used. Measurements were performed in a large open square in a high latitude city—Göteborg, Sweden—during clear to overcast weather conditions in October 2005 and in July and August 2006. Results show that the difference between Method A and Method B was generally relatively small. Most of the discrepancy, caused by rapid changes in radiation, temperature and wind speed was smoothed out using 5 min mean values. By systematically and empirically changing the mean convection coefficient, the accuracy of Method B was improved and a new equation expressing the Tmrt was obtained. With this new equation the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer could successfully be used to estimate the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting provided that the wind speed and the air and globe temperatures are measured accurately. The study also shows that the flat grey colour of the globe thermometer slightly underestimates the level of short-wave radiation (i.e. sunshine). Method C works very well during the middle of the day in July, i.e. at high sun elevations. However, the model considerably underestimates the Tmrt in the morning and evening in July and during the whole day in October, i.e. at low sun elevations. In outdoor urban settings where thermal comfort researchers or urban planners and designers require an easy and reliable method of estimating mean radiant temperature, the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer provides a good and cheap solution.

We found a great variety of instruments and methods used to measure meteorological variables, especially with respect to the mean radiant temperature and wind speed. Moreover, many different subjective judgement scales were used to assess subjective thermal perception, thermal neutrality and thermal preference and a multitude of thermal indices were used to quantify the combined effect of meteorological variables on thermal perception. The use of a variety of methods makes it difficult to compare results of the different studies. There is thus a need for standardization and to give guidance regarding how to conduct field surveys in outdoor environments. Such standards and guidelines should give advice regarding the choice of measurement sites, type and positioning of instruments, appropriate methods to determine the mean radiant temperature, questionnaire design and suitable thermal comfort indices. These guidelines should also include advice on reporting.},

We analyzed the literature relating work performance with temperature, and found a general decrement in work performance when temperatures exceeded those associated with thermal neutrality. These studies included physiological modelling, performance of various tasks in laboratory experiments and measured productivity at work in real buildings. The studies indicate an average 2\% decrement in work performance per degree C temperature rise, when the temperature is above 25 C. When we use this relationship to evaluate night-time ventilative cooling, the resulting benefit to cost ratio varies from 32 to 120.},

The aim of our research was to see which the influence of the room geometry on the mean radiant temperature is, assuming similar heating systems and thermal properties of the building envelope. It was found that mean radiant temperature has a parabolic variation with the room height and length, so for a room shape there is a certain height for which the mean radiant temperature is minimal. The occupant position in the room influences the obtained values. Lower mean radiant temperature values are obtained for surface heating systems.

It combines the easy utilisation of the previous version for {TRNSYS} with the additional features of a more detailed version. The new improvements concern the local heat transfer along the flow path within the storage region. The modifications are based on detailed analyses of the thermal interaction between a solar collector field and a duct store. The {DST} model has been validated against measurements from several duct stores in operation. Detailed and time-consuming programmes were used to check the implementation of the new features. The present model is still reasonably fast and a large range of energy systems can be analysed for optimisation purposes.},

The first part of the paper derives the fundamental equations for {BHE} systems and their finite element representations, where the thermal exchange between the borehole components is modeled via thermal transfer relations. For this purpose improved relationships for thermal resistances and capacities of {BHE} are introduced. Pipe-to-grout thermal transfer possesses multiple grout points for double U-shape and single U-shape {BHE} to attain a more accurate modeling. The numerical solution of the final 3D problems is performed via a widely non-sequential (essentially non-iterative) coupling strategy for the {BHE} and porous medium discretization. Four types of vertical {BHE} are supported: double U-shape (2U) pipe, single U-shape (1U) pipe, coaxial pipe with annular ({CXA}) and centred ({CXC}) inlet. Two computational strategies are used: (1) The analytical {BHE} method based on Eskilson and Claesson's (1988) solution, (2) numerical {BHE} method based on Al-Khoury et al.'s (2005) solution. The second part of the paper focusses on {BHE} meshing aspects, the validation of {BHE} solutions and practical applications for borehole thermal energy store systems.},

In this paper, a new radiation model ({SOLWEIG} 1.0), which simulates spatial variations of 3D radiation fluxes and Tmrt in complex urban settings, is presented. The Tmrt is derived by modelling shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes in six directions (upward, downward and from the four cardinal points) and angular factors. The model requires a limited number of inputs, such as direct, diffuse and global shortwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, urban geometry and geographical information (latitude, longitude and elevation). The model was evaluated using 7 days of integral radiation measurements at two sites with different building geometries – a large square and a small courtyard in Göteborg, Sweden (57°N) – across different seasons and in various weather conditions. The evaluation reveals good agreement between modelled and measured values of Tmrt, with an overall good correspondence of R2 = 0.94, (p {\textless} 0.01, {RMSE} = 4.8 K). {SOLWEIG} 1.0 is still under development. Future work will incorporate a vegetation scheme, as well as an improvement of the estimation of fluxes from the four cardinal points.},

In this paper, the use of low enthalpy geothermal energy that consists of converting mine galleries in underground heat exchangers is described and analysed. The system would be used in those areas with mining works that with a near future closure, such as Asturias but also other regions of Spain or Europe. The described system, unlike other proposed ones, implies to act before the closure of the mines, when it is possible to access underground galleries. A prediction method for evaluating the system capabilities has been developed which has been calibrated with measurements taken in underground mines and which can be used and calibrated in any mine in operation. Finally, using the method, the capabilities of a typical system are analysed and its viavility from a technical, economic and environmental point of view is proved.},

	abstract = {The main parameters evaluated with a conventional thermal response test ({TRT}) are the subsurface thermal conductivity surrounding the borehole and the effective borehole thermal resistance, when averaging the inlet and outlet temperature of a ground heat exchanger with the arithmetic mean. This effective resistance depends on two resistances: the 2D borehole resistance (Rb) and the 2D internal resistance (Ra) which is associated to the short-circuit effect between pipes in the borehole. This paper presents a ﬁeld method to evaluate these two components separately. Two approaches are proposed. In the ﬁrst case, the temperature at the bottom of the borehole is measured at the same time as the inlet and outlet temperatures as done in a conventional {TRT}. In the second case, different ﬂow rates are used during the experiment to infer the internal resistance. Both approaches assumed a predeﬁned temperature proﬁle inside the borehole. The methods were applied to real experimental tests and compared with numerical simulations. Interesting results were found by comparison with theoretical resistances calculated with the multipole method. The motivation for this work is evidenced by analyzing the impact of the internal resistance on a typical geothermal system design. It is shown to be important to know both resistance components to predict the variation of the effective resistance when the ﬂow rate and the height of the boreholes are changed during the design process.},

These formed the basis for the equations used in 1985 {FAO}/{WHO}/{UNU} document, Energy and Protein Requirements.While Schofield's analysis has served a significant role in re-establishing the importance of using basal metabolic rate ({BMR}) to predict human energy requirements, recent workers have subsequently queried the universal validity and application of these equations. A survey of the most recent studies (1980–2000) in {BMR} suggests that in most cases the current {FAO}/{WHO}/{UNU} predictive equations overestimate {BMR} in many communities. The {FAO}/{WHO}/{UNU} equations to predict {BMR} were developed using a database that contained a disproportionate number – 3388 out of 7173 (47\%) – of Italian subjects. The Schofield database contained relatively few subjects from the tropical region.The objective here is to review the historical development in the measurement and application of {BMR} and to critically review the Schofield et al. {BMR} database presenting a series of new equations to predict {BMR}.{DesignThis} division, while arbitrary, will enable readers who wish to omit the historical review of {BMR} to concentrate on the evolution of the new {BMR} equations.{SettingBMR} data collected from published and measured values.{SubjectsA} series of new equations (Oxford equations) have been developed using a data set of 10 552 {BMR} values that (1) excluded all the Italian subjects and (2) included a much larger number (4018) of people from the tropics.{ResultsIn} general, the Oxford equations tend to produce lower {BMR} values than the current {FAO}/{WHO}/{UNU} equations in 18–30 and 30–60 year old males and in all females over 18 years of age.{ConclusionsThis} is an opportune moment to re-examine the role and place of {BMR} measurements in estimating total energy requirements today. The Oxford equations' future use and application will surely depend on their ability to predict more accurately the {BMR} in contemporary populations.},

Resting metabolic rate was also predicted using equations from the literature.Results: Resting metabolic rate (mean±s.d.) in normal weight subjects was 7983±1007 {kJ}/24 h (males) and 6127±907 {kJ}/24 h (females). Measured {RMR} and predicted {RMR} values using various equations from the literature were significantly different in males and females, except for the Harris–Benedict equation and the Schofield equations. Also, in overweight and obese subjects the prediction error was generally larger compared to normal-weight subjects for all formulas except for the Harris–Benedict and Schofield formulas. In overweight and obese males but not in females, {RMR} was lower than in normal-weight subjects after correcting for weight and age differences. Stepwise multiple regression of resting metabolic rate against weight, height and age in males and females did not reveal a prediction formula with a lower prediction error than the Harris–Benedict or Schofield formulas and thus was not further explored.Conclusions: The Harris–Benedict formula and the Schofield formula provide a valid estimation of resting metabolic rate at a group level in both normal-weight and overweight Italians. However, the individual error can be so high that for individual use a measured value has to be preferred over an estimated value.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001) 55, 208–214},

Body composition was determined by hydrodensitometry. 24EE was 124 +/- 38 kcal/d (P less than 0.002) higher in males than females after adjusting for differences in fat-free mass, fat mass, and age. Spontaneous physical activity was not significantly different between males and females. Since adjusted 24EE was 106 +/- 39 kcal/d (P less than 0.01) higher in females during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle compared with females during the follicular phase, energy expenditure was analyzed in a subset (greater than 50 yr) to minimize the confounding effect of menstrual status. 24EE (160 +/- 66 kcal/d; P less than 0.03), {BMR} (116 +/- 45; P less than 0.02), and {SMR} (208 +/- 68 kcal/d; P less than 0.005) were higher in males compared with females of the older subset after adjusting for differences in body composition, age, and activity.

Energy conservation, availability and entropy balances were performed to obtain the entropy generated for the main food components. Quantitative results for entropy generation were obtained as a function of age using the databases from the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board ({FNB}) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC}), which provide energy requirements and food intake composition as a function of age, weight and stature. Numerical integration was performed through human lifespan for different levels of physical activity. Results were presented and analyzed. Entropy generated over the lifespan of average individuals (natural death) was found to be 11,404 {kJ}/ºK per kg of body mass with a rate of generation three times higher on infants than on the elderly. The entropy generated predicts a life span of 73.78 and 81.61 years for the average U.S. male and female individuals respectively, which are values that closely match the average lifespan from statistics (74.63 and 80.36 years). From the analysis of the effect of different activity levels, it is shown that entropy generated increases with physical activity, suggesting that exercise should be kept to a “healthy minimum” if entropy generation is to be minimized.},

While closed systems eventually reach equilibria characterized by minimum Gibbs free energy and maximum entropy, Prigogine1 and de Groot2 have predicted that open systems will approach steady states of minimum entropy production. On this basis, Prigogine and Wiame3 have inferred that living organisms grow towards a state of minimum metabolism per unit mass, but this view and other discussions4 on this theme are subject to two criticisms. On one hand, the theorem of minimum entropy production holds only for open systems very near to the steady state5 and, on the other, it has never been tested experimentally for living organisms so that conclusions derived from it are weakened to some extent.},

In the case of living matter this corresponds approximately to states of minimum metabolism. During this evolution the entropy contained in the system may decrease whilst the heterogenity increases. But this increase in heterogenity can only take place when there is a decrease in the entropy production, that is an evolution of the metabolism. We are thus led to suggest a physicochemical interpretation of Lamarchism. Finally we call attention to the fact that the moderation principle {ofLe} Chatelier-Braun is not limited to equilibrium states.},

	abstract = {The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors and past thermal history modify building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current {ASHRAE} comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the {ASHRAE} {RP}-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted means vote ({PMV}) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in {HVAC} buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.},

Exergy recognizes that the energy that is carried by substances can only be used ‘down ’ to the level that is given by the environment. Unlike energy, exergy is not subject to a conservation law. This paper presents an outline of an exergy analysis tool for buildings and building services, including a new graphic input interface being developed with the aim of enhancing its user-friendliness. The idea underlying this interface is that energy engineers and building designers may approach the same contents from different perspectives. The tool illustrates energy and exergy flows in a building, including energy conversion steps in the building and building services, and exergy dissipation via the building envelope as a result of heat transmission and ventilation. The main advantage of this tool is that it enables a designer to compare energy and exergy flows for different building and building service configurations, from primary energy conversion through to the heating system and building envelope. 1.},

In this study, we proposed a new effective {WBGT} ({WBGTeff}*) for general vapor permeable clothing ensembles and vapor impermeable protective clothing that is applicable to occupants engaged in moderate intensity work with a metabolic heat production value of around 174W/m2. {WBGTeff}* enables the conversion of heat stress into the scale experienced by the occupant dressed in the basic clothing ensemble (work clothes) based on the heat balances for a human body. We confirmed that {WBGTeff}* was effective for expressing the critical thermal environments for the prescriptive zones for occupants wearing vapor impermeable protective clothing. Based on {WBGTeff}*, we succeeded in clarifying how the weights for natural wet bulb, globe, and air temperatures and the intercept changed depending on clothing properties and the surrounding environmental factors when heat stress is expressed by the weighted sum of natural wet bulb, globe, and air temperatures and the intercept. The weight of environmental temperatures (globe and air temperatures) for {WBGTeff}* for vapor impermeable protective clothing increased compared with that for general vapor permeable clothing, whereas that of the natural wet bulb temperature decreased. For {WBGTeff}* in outdoor conditions with a solar load, the weighting ratio of globe temperature increased and that of air temperature decreased with air velocity. Approximation equations of {WBGTeff}* were proposed for both general vapor permeable clothing ensembles and for vapor impermeable protective clothing.},

	abstract = {This study aims at evaluating the feasibility of an installation for space heating and cooling the building of the university in the center of the city Aachen, Germany, with a 2500 m deep coaxial borehole heat exchanger ({BHE}). Direct heating the building in winter requires temperatures of 40°C. In summer, cooling the university building uses a climatic control adsorption unit, which requires a temperature of minimum 55°C. The drilled rocks of the 2500 m deep borehole have extremely low permeabilities and porosities less than 1\%. Their thermal conductivity varies between 2.2 W/(m·K) and 8.9 W/(m·K). The high values are related to the quartzite sandstones. The maximum temperature in the borehole is 85°C at 2500 m depth, which corresponds to a mean specific heat flow of 85 {mW}/m2–90 {mW}/m2. Results indicate that for a short period, the borehole may deliver the required temperature. But after a 20-year period of operation, temperatures are too low to drive the adsorption unit for cooling. In winter, however, the borehole heat exchanger may still supply the building with sufficient heat, with temperatures varying between 25 and 55°C and a circulation flow rate of 10 m3/h at maximum.},

Application of exergy principles in the context of energy supply systems may achieve a more efficient energy-supply chain and a rational use of energy in buildings. This paper presents the exergy-based operation optimization of a Distributed Energy System ({DES}) by considering the whole energy-supply chain from energy resources to user demands. The problem is challenging in view of the complicated interactions of devices and the modeling of exergy losses. To capture these complicated interactions, energy networks are established with exergy losses modeled at the conversion step. A multi-objective mixed integer programming problem is formulated. The problem is efficiently solved by the novel integration of the surrogate Lagrangian relaxation and branch-and-cut. The Pareto frontier, including the best possible trade-offs between the economic and exergetic objectives, is obtained by minimizing a weighted sum of the total energy cost and total exergy losses occurring in the energy conversion step. Results demonstrate that the use of high-quality energy resources is reduced by the reduction of exergy losses through the optimized operation of the energy-supply chain, leading to the sustainability of energy supply systems.},

Heating, cooling and lighting appliances in buildings account for more than one third of the world’s primary energy demand. In turn, building stock is a major contributor to energy-related environmental problems. There are great potentials, which can be obtained through a more efficient use of energy in buildings. An optimisation of the exergy flows in buildings and the related supply structures, similar to other thermodynamic systems such as power stations, can help in identifying the potential of increased efficiency in energy utilisation. Through analyses, it can be shown that calculations based on the energy conservation and primary energy concept alone are inadequate for gaining a full understanding of all important aspects of energy utilisation processes. The high potential for a further increase in the efficiency of; for example, boilers, can not be quantified by energy analysis- the energy efficiency is close to 100\%; however, this potential can be showed by using exergy analysis [1], the exergy efficiency of a common gas boiler is about},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive method to calculate object to object diffuse reflections within complex environments containing hidden surfaces and shadows. In essence, each object in the environment is treated as a secondary light source. The method provides an accurate representation of the "diffuse" and "ambient" terms found in typical image synthesis algorithms. The phenomena of "color bleeding" from one surface to another, shading within shadow envelopes, and penumbras along shadow boundaries are accurately reproduced. Additional advantages result because computations are indepedent of viewer position. This allows the efficient rendering of multiple views of the same scene for dynamic sequences. Light sources can be modulated and object reflectivities can be changed, with minimal extra computation. The procedures extend the radiosity method beyond the bounds previously imposed.},

In that time scale, the borehole thermal capacitance is generally neglected, since the time span of interest is on the order of months or years. The borehole thermal capacitance consists both of grouting material and heat carrier fluid, and it mostly affects the short time-step behavior, when hourly or shorter time intervals are considered. Some models are available in the literature for short time-step simulations of borehole heat exchangers. In this article, short time-step analyses of coaxial and double U-tube heat exchangers are performed by means of numerical capacity resistance model. The capacity resistance model is compared with field measurements, analytical solutions available in the literature, and commercial software based on the finite-element method. Further comparisons between coaxial and common double U-tube heat exchangers are carried out by means of measurements performed in a suitable plant system. Furthermore, the series and parallel arrangements for double U-tube heat exchangers are investigated considering the borehole thermal capacitance.},

	abstract = {Over the past century more than 100 indices have been developed and used to assess bioclimatic conditions for human beings. The majority of these indices are used sporadically or for specific purposes. Some are based on generalized results of measurements (wind chill, cooling power, wet bulb temperature) and some on the empirically observed reactions of the human body to thermal stress (physiological strain, effective temperature). Those indices that are based on human heat balance considerations are referred to as "rational indices". Several simple human heat balance models are known and are used in research and practice. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the newly developed Universal Thermal Climate Index ({UTCI}), and some of the more prevalent thermal indices. The analysis is based on three groups of data: global data-set, synoptic datasets from Europe, and local scale data from special measurement campaigns of {COST} Action 730. We found the present indices to express bioclimatic conditions reasonably only under specific meteorological situations, while the {UTCI} represents specific climates, weather, and locations much better. Furthermore, similar to the human body, the {UTCI} is very sensitive to changes in ambient stimuli: temperature, solar radiation, wind and humidity. {UTCI} depicts temporal variability of thermal conditions better than other indices. The {UTCI} scale is able to express even slight differences in the intensity of meteorological stimuli.},

Its measurement is not direct and is usually carried out by means of different methodologies and instruments whose general details and accuracy requirements are reported in the {ISO} Standard 7726. This paper deals with a critical review on the typical measurement methodologies combined with a comparative analysis of the metrological performances exhibited by the more common practice instruments on the market. To this purpose a special room-test has been designed aiming to reproduce the typical microclimatic conditions can be encountered in workplaces both in summer and in winter conditions. The effect of the measurement methodology and used instruments on the thermal comfort (global and local) and the thermal stress assessment has been finally discussed. Obtained results show that the use of different instruments consistent with {ISO} Standard 7726 requirements results in values of the mean radiant temperature compatible with each other, but the consequences on thermal environment assessment appear often ambiguous. Obtained results have focused the need for starting an in-depth discussion on the measurements’ protocols and the instruments leading to a possible reduction of the required accuracy levels reported in the {ISO} Standard 7726.},

	doi = {10.1109/IECON.2016.7793073},
	abstract = {Mean Radiant Temperature ({MRT}) is an important factor of Fanger's {PMV} model, which is the most popular method to study human thermal comfort. However, it has often been a practice to assume {MRT} equal to air temperature (Ta) during indoor thermal studies. In this paper, we have studied the consequences of this simplistic assumption on the thermal comfort of occupants in air-conditioned buildings. A worldwide database of about 10000 occupants covering 9 climatic zones and 4 seasons has been studied. The effect on comfort indices-Predicted Mean Vote ({PMV}), Actual Mean Vote ({AMV}), Thermal Acceptability Vote ({TSA}) and Thermal Preference Vote ({MCI}) are presented. It is observed that even a small difference in Ta and {MRT} can lead to significant error in determination of thermal comfort. A correlation study between {AMV} and the six Macpherson factors reveals that {MRT} has the highest positive correlation with the thermal sensation reported by the occupants. Study of {TSA} and {MCI} show that the assumption is more likely to affect comfort level determination in the uncomfortable range.},

Study shows that velocity profiles are in good agreement between numerical simulation and similarity solution for high aspect ratio in the stagnation-point region. Numerical simulation results of nonzero vorticity region find that boundary-layer thickness is constant in the stagnation-point region where vorticity generated at a wall is prevented from diffusing far away from it by convection of the vorticity toward the wall. In the region far away from the stagnation point the boundary-layer thickness is decreasing along the wall in which balance between diffusion and convection of vorticity is no longer valid.},

Focus is on the passive system, which is composed by 15 cylindrical elements and it includes heat transfer between large arteries and veins.

	abstract = {Thermal conductivity and thermal borehole resistance are basic parameters for the technical and sustainable design of closed ground source heat pump ({GSHP}) systems. One of the most common methods to determine these parameters is the thermal response test ({TRT}). The response data measured are typically evaluated by the Kelvin line source equation which does not consider all relevant processes of heat transfer in the subsurface. The approach only considers conductive heat transfer from the borehole heat exchanger ({BHE}) and all transport effects are combined in the parameters of effective thermal conductivity and thermal borehole resistance. In order to examine primary effects in more detail, a sensitivity study based on numerically generated {TRT} data sets is performed considering the effects of (1) the in-situ position of the U-shaped pipes of borehole heat exchangers (shank spacing), (2) a non-uniform initial thermal distribution (such as a geothermal gradient), and (3) thermal dispersivity. It will be demonstrated that the shank spacing and the non-uniform initial thermal distribution have minor effects (less than 10\%) on the effective thermal conductivity and the determined borehole resistance. Constant groundwater velocity with varying thermal dispersivity values, however, has a significant influence on the thermal borehole resistance. These effects are even more pronounced for interpreted effective thermal conductivity which is overestimated by a factor of 1.2–2.9 compared to the real thermal conductivity of the saturated porous media.},

The entropy production thus calculated becomes positive. The magnitude of entropy production per effective radiating surface area does not show any significant variation with subjects. The entropy production is nearly constant at the calorimeter temperatures of 26–32°C; the average in this temperature range is 0·172 J m−2 sec−1 K−1. The forced air currents around the human body and also clothing have almost no effect in changing the entropy production.

The reason for the intensive and extensive use of exergy concept is to deepen our understanding of the built environment and thereby to develop a variety of low-exergy systems for future buildings. First, the essence of exergy balance equations is reviewed and then some results obtained from the recent exergy research were presented. The important findings described in this paper are as follows: (1) a volume of indoor air contains both of “warm” or “cool” exergy and of “wet” or “dry” exergy, whose values are comparable to each other especially for a hot and humid summer condition; (2) an ordinary air-source heat pump is basically a device to separate exergy supplied by electricity into warm, cool and dry exergies by consuming more than 85\% of the supplied exergy; (3) there is a set of a little higher mean radiant temperature and a little lower air temperature, which provides with the lowest human body exergy consumption rate in winter season; (4) availability of cool radiant exergy of 20–40mW/m2 seems to play a key role for thermal comfort in a naturally-ventilated room in summer season; and (5) “cool” radiant exergy available from the sky in hot and humid regions amounts to 1000mW/m2, which is not necessarily small if compared to the values of cool radiant exergy to be supplied indoors.},

These benefits stem from the improved productivity of the office worker in most favorable thermal environment and the possibilities to achieve this with lower energy demand. This study uses a new approach, exergy analysis, to recognise the optimal conditions by looking for the combination of mean radiant temperature and room air temperature giving the lowest human body exergy consumption rate. All of the commonly used thermal comfort prediction methods use energy analysis, and it seems that exergy analysis could give more accurate prediction of the conditions giving optimal thermal comfort. The new method is applied to the case of office worker in typical and extreme weather conditions in Finland. The results agree well with the previous analyses, and moreover, the points giving minimum human body exergy consumption rate coincide with the points usually regarded as most comfortable in summer conditions.

Exergy is a thermodynamic property that links the first and the second thermodynamic principles as well as connects a system under study with the environment where it belongs. Since the first principle of thermodynamics measures quantity of energy and the second measures irreversibilities, i.e. quality of energy, having a single thermodynamic indicator which is able to deal with both issues at the same time means a great advance in energy sustainability studies. Our review shows that using exergy for weak sustainability studies presents some problems, but still offers a worthy contribution to this field, more valuable than pure economic analyses. Strong sustainability assessments featuring exergy show more drawbacks and complications, but can also play a key role in a sustainability framework designed in order to obtain sustainable policies which are able to maintain homeostatic relations between the system under study and its environment, thus complementing traditional economic approaches which are mainly focused on the economic and social poles of sustainability.},

With exergy analysis based on the connective thinking approach, thermal exergy flows through the building envelope are analysed jointly with human body exergy balance. Two cases of building envelope systems, thermally well-insulated case and thermally non-insulated case, are located at four typical climates (temperate, cold, hot/dry, hot/humid). “Warm” and “cool” exergies transferred by radiation, convection and conduction at the interior surface of an envelope are calculated with methodology developed by Shukuya (2013) [7,35]. Human body exergy balance ({hBExB}) is calculated with software developed by Asada (2010) [6]. Results show that thermal insulation significantly reduces the exergy consumption rate ({ExCr}) within building envelope systems in all climates. Additionally, it allows the interior surfaces of building envelope to emit “warm” radiant exergy into the room space in temperate and cold climates, while on the other hand to emit “cool” radiant exergy instead of “warm” radiant exergy in hot/dry and hot/humid climates. Thermal insulation has important benefits on {hBExB} in all climates; it decreases human body exergy consumption rate ({hbExCr}) due to lower input exergy and higher output exergy. Exergy analysis based on the connective thinking approach helps us to understand all interactions between building systems and human body and consequently approach to the quantitative evaluation of comfort and healthy living and working conditions.},

Recently this thermodynamic approach has been expanded with the application of the second law of thermodynamics. In this paper, an exergy-based analysis of the relation between the human and its environment is presented. Heat and mass flow rate due to convection, radiation, evaporation and respiration are calculated and expressed in terms of exergy loss. This value is used in the modified Fanger's thermal comfort model, where the heat balance equation is replaced by the exergy loss. The paper builds upon prior studies on determination of internal and external exergy losses by revised and newly defined formulas taking into account clothing and indoor conditions. The results quantitatively show that thermal energy load in the original Fanger's {PMV} model could be substituted by exergy loss and it corresponds to a certain level of subjective assessed thermal comfort level.},

We set up an experiment that the subjects stayed in two rooms, one with natural ventilation and the other with mechanical air-conditioning. According to “energy” calculation, input energy rate almost the same as the total of output energy rate, within which a portion by sweat secretion in naturally ventilated room was larger than that in mechanically air-conditioned room. On the other hand, according to “exergy” calculation, the large portion of input exergy rate consisting mainly of metabolism and liquid water by sweat secretion was found to be consumed. In naturally ventilated room, the exergy consumption rate increases by walking and then decreases gradually towards the end of staying, but in mechanically air-conditioned room it suddenly became large right after entering and dropped more sharply than in naturally ventilated room. This is because the liquid water by sweat, which has wet exergy, dispersed into the surrounding air very rapidly in mechanically air-conditioned room whose humidity is very low. The measured values of sweat evaporation rate were larger than the calculated values based on the two-node model although their patterns of variation were similar to each other. Conventional air conditioning for cooling, which necessitates a large input of exergy by electricity, was found to result in a large amount of human-body exergy consumption.},

	abstract = {Exergy analysis has been used in various fields to quantify the efficiency of various energy transfer processes. So far, most exergy analyses have been performed by assuming steady-state conditions both for a system of focus and its environment. However, steady-state analyses may idealize a problem too much and thereby limit what we can know about the system, since the assumed system is only a snapshot of a certain condition or moment. In particular, a steady-state exergy analysis is not suitable for analyzing problems where the system has a large heat capacity and problems with varying boundary conditions. To understand the exergy transfer and consumption processes in a system whose transient characteristics are critical, an unsteady-state exergy analysis must be conducted. This study presents a methodology for unsteady-state exergy analysis that can be used to study heat conduction problems. Governing equations of entropy and exergy to be parallel to the governing equation of energy are derived in their partial differential forms, and their numerical methods are presented in detail. Based on the proposed methodology, an unsteady-state exergy analysis of a heat conduction problem for a concrete wall is carried out to demonstrate its transient exergy behavior.},

As comfort temperature, determined in accordance with exergy approach is lower than based on energy one, the exergy concept use for providing comfort conditions accounts for less energy need for heating. Modelling results of various factors impact on energy need for heating are obtained based on energy and exergy approach to human comfort.},

It is found that the metabolism energy and exergy rates are the major part of the human body’s energy generation. However, metabolism energy rate (58.326W/m2) is much higher than corresponding exergetic one (1.661W/m2). The maximum energy loss of the human body (70.59\%) occurs due to heat exchange such as radiation, convection, and conduction. On the other hand, the maximum exergy loss of the human body happens due to exhaled humid air (6.393\%), while the most of the total exergy is consumed by the human body (90.786\%). Thermal comfort condition is also calculated. The Predicted Mean Vote ({PMV}) rate is found as 0.028 which means that the thermal sensation of the human body is called as comfortable. Furthermore, the Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied ({PPD}) rate is determined to be 5.017\% which is low and shows the thermally dissatisfied people percentages.},

The basis for this paper is the existence of a formal similarity between the parameters defining human heat and mass transfer governed by physiological processes and the parameters defining exergy destruction. Basic heat and mass transfer is calculated using a standard two-node human physiological model. To enable an exergy analysis the model was divided according to heat and mass transfer over appropriate boundaries. The exergy analysis was performed for each process with regard to the type of exergy that participates in heat and mass exchange with respect to the indoor environment. The results provide insight into the complex interactions between the human body and environment as characterized by exergy destruction. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that at given physiological parameters only a certain combination of environmental conditions ensures minimal exergy destruction.

Therefore, the next step towards the understanding of the effects of pathologies on the exergy behavior of human body is to analyze human heart. In the present work, an exergy model of human heart is developed. The heart is divided into two control volumes: the left heart, which pumps arterial blood from the lungs to the organs, and the right heart, which pumps venous blood from the organs to the lungs. Exergy of metabolism, exergy transfer associated to heat of metabolism, difference of exergy of blood flows and performed work are taken into account in the exergy balance for normotensive and hypertensive people under different levels of exercise. The left part of the heart is always responsible for more than 80\% of the total exergy destruction. Moreover, a hypertensive heart destroys more exergy; this surplus value, when integrated along life cycle, represents 170 {MJ}/kg of destroyed exergy, which, according to the rate of living theory, would lead to a loss of 4.4 years in life expectancy.},

Hypothermia is also used during surgeries and circulatory arrest. In this article, the objective temperature of hypothermia is 32 °C, which is considered mild: 32–35 °C. Three techniques of hypothermia induction were considered: external blood cooling, endovascular cooling with a catheter insertion and water bath. Energy and exergy analyses were performed to determine the clinical effectiveness of these techniques and to evaluate the best test parameters, from which it was possible to calculate the body internal temperature, destroyed exergy and exergy efficiency. Moreover, it was proposed an exergy performance index, which takes into account the ability of a given technique to change the exergy of the body. Results indicate that therapeutic hypothermia takes the subject to a state of lower destroyed exergy and higher body exergy efficiency. The exergy performance index shows that lower rates of cooling lead to a better transformation of the exergy removed from the body into variation of the body exergy.},

Herein, the exergy destroyed rate of the human body will be determined as a function of temperature and humidity for three levels of exercise. For the sake of comparison, thermal comfort will also be assessed by means of {PMV} (Predicted Mean Vote) index. Results indicate that, the higher the relative humidity, the lower the temperature of thermal comfort and, for the same humidity, the higher the exercise intensity, the smaller the temperature of thermal comfort. On the other hand, the values of {PMV} do not vary much with relative humidity, what indicates that the effect of this parameter is almost neglected by this method. Besides, the difference between the three levels of exercise was not as pronounced as in the exergy method. During activity, the values of the exergy flow rate due to evaporation for thermal comfort are smaller in the exergy method than in the conventional one. Thus, it can be said that, under physical activities, the exergy method for thermal comfort seems to be a reliable alternative to the conventional one.},

The cardiopulmonary exercise test is one of the most used tests to assess the functional capacity of individuals with varying degrees of physical training. To perform the exergy analysis during the test, it is necessary to calculate heat and mass flow rates, associated with radiation, convection, vaporization and respiration, determined from the measurements and some relations found in the literature. The energy balance allowed the determination of the internal temperature over time and the exergy variation of the body along the experiment. Eventually, it was possible to calculate the destroyed exergy and the exergy efficiency from the exergy analysis. The exergy rates and flow rates are dependent of the exercise level and the body metabolism. The results show that the relation between the destroyed exergy and the metabolism is almost constant during the test, furthermore its value has a great dependence of the subject age. From the exergy analysis it was possible to divide the subjects according to their training level, for the same destroyed exergy, subjects with higher lactate threshold can perform more work.},

In literature only destroyed exergy has been used to evaluate thermal sensation. To perform the exergy balance it is necessary to calculate the exergy variation of the body over time which is a composition of metabolic exergy and the exergy variation due to transient environmental conditions. The exergy transfer to the environment is calculated as the sum of the terms associated with radiation, convection, evaporation and respiration. The thermal behavior of the human body is simulated by a model composed of 15 cylinders, naked and dressed for winter seasons, as a function of the air temperature, mean radiant temperature and relative humidity. The energy equation is solved to obtain transitory response of the body due to a variation in environmental conditions and the energy transfer to the environment. For relative humidities between 40\% and 60\%, results indicate that the destroyed exergy is minimal for thermal comfort conditions. Nevertheless, for low relative humidities and high temperatures the destroyed exergy is also minimal, indicating the necessity of another physical quantity to evaluate thermal comfort conditions. At this point the exergy transfer to environment is high, showing that the body may not be at thermal comfort condition. This article proposes is to use two terms of the exergy analysis to evaluate the thermal comfort condition: destroyed exergy and exergy transfer to environment.},

It helps to optimize climate conditioning systems so that they meet the requirements of sustainable building design. As the building should provide a healthy and comfortable environment for its occupants, it is reasonable to consider both the exergy flows in building and those within the human body. Until now, no data have been available on the relation between human-body exergy consumption rates and subjectively assessed thermal sensation. The objective of the present work was to relate thermal sensation data, from earlier thermal comfort studies, to calculated human-body exergy consumption rates. The results show that the minimum human body exergy consumption rate is associated with thermal sensation votes close to thermal neutrality, tending to the slightly cool side of thermal sensation. Generally, the relationship between air temperature and the exergy consumption rate, as a first approximation, shows an increasing trend. Taking account of both convective and radiative heat exchange between the human body and the surrounding environment by using the calculated operative temperature, exergy consumption rates increase as the operative temperature increases above 24°C or decreases below 22°C. With the data available so far, a second-order polynomial relationship between thermal sensation and the exergy consumption rate was established.},

The human body exergy consumption calculated by the formula was compared with values calculated using Shukuya's formula for a typical office environment. The results show that human body exergy consumption calculated by either of these formulas reaches a minimum under the same thermal condition. It is shown that this is in accordance with expectation. The relation between human performance and human body exergy consumption was studied by analyzing the data obtained in simulated office environments in winter. The results show that human body exergy consumption and human performance are inversely as operative temperature changes from 17 to 28°C or human thermal sensation changes from −1.0 to +1.4, and that optimum thermal comfort cannot be expected to lead to optimal human performance, as has so often been assumed. According to the second law of thermodynamics, it makes sense that optimal human performance coincides with minimum human body exergy consumption and that this should occur under thermal conditions in which human thermal sensation is close to “slightly cool”.},

This gives the direct solar radiation, alternatively the output can be fed to an electronic integrator having large time constant so that it can integrate heat radiation flux to a predetermined level and generate a pulse. The pulses generated due to solar radiation are counted by a small electromechanical counter. The total counts corrected for the calibration factor represented integrated heat radiation flux during the time of ergonomics studies. This small portable instrument can give the idea of radiative heat load during usual work and also its reduction attainable when sun shades or protectors are used for improvement of the working conditions. This low-cost battery powered prototype was constructed in the laboratory and the performance compared with other standard was found to be satisfactory.},

Three models of the transient systems simulation program ({TRNSYS}) have been compared to these measurements. In order to assess the deviations a 3D-{FEM} model, built in {COMSOL} Multiphysics®, is compared to the measurement as well. The “Erdwärmesonden” model ({EWS}) shows a very good accuracy with a deviation less than 10\%. The superposition borehole model ({SBM}) and duct ground heat storage model ({DST}) neglect the internal borehole heat capacity of fluid and grout. In order to improve their short-term behavior, the models are modified with an adiabatic pipe model with wall capacity in front of the {BHE} model. Different parameter sets for the pre-pipe are investigated. The optimum parameter set reduces the error between simulation and measurement of the injected heat from 50\% to about 5\%. With this model modification, all investigated models {SBM}, {DST}, and {EWS} perform as accurate as the {COMSOL} model.},

	abstract = {The potentiality of geocooling (i.e. free cooling) with borehole heat exchangers is analysed for low energy office buildings. The borehole heat exchanger field is coupled to a heat pump in winter and to the cold distribution system in summer through a flat plate heat exchanger. The cooling requirement satisfied by a direct heat transfer into the ground through the borehole heat exchangers is so-called geocooling. A dynamic system model has been developed to simulate the building, the emission of thermal energy through thermally activated building systems, the technical installation including the borehole heat exchanger field and the interconnected thermal interactions. Thermal comfort requirements determine the building energy needs and the size of the ground coupled system. A methodology is presented for best system design. Building design, system technical feasibility and limits of the ground coupled system are discussed and result from the analysis of the numerous system simulations. Geocooling potential depends on the quality of the building design and its heat emission. The importance of the ground thermal conductivity and the ground recharge ratio on the system design are highlighted. Simple design sizing keys are proposed for a fast pre-sizing of a borehole field.},

Linear temperature gradients in the lower part of the room were found, in all cases, to be driven by convection from the adjacent walls. Significant mixing, indicated by reduced temperature gradients, was evident in the upper part of the room in the chilled ceiling results at higher levels of heat gain. Visualization experiments, velocity measurements and related numerical studies indicated that with greater heat gains the plumes have sufficient momentum to drive flow across the ceiling surface and down the walls. The significance of forced, as opposed to natural convection, is also suggested by relatively low Richardson Number (Ri) values found near the ceiling. Furthermore, in cases with moderately high internal gains, comparison of the temperature gradients indicated that the effect of ceiling surface temperature on the degree of mixing and the magnitude of the temperature gradient were of secondary importance. These findings are in contrast to the view that it is natural convection at the ceiling that causes enhanced mixing.},

A typical chilled ceiling/displacement ventilation office has been created within a laboratory test room, in which the ceiling temperature can be varied over a range of typical operating values; the thermal comfort of eight female test subjects was then measured in the test room over the range of ceiling temperatures. Vertical radiant temperature asymmetry was found to have an insignificant effect on the overall thermal comfort of the seated occupants for the typical range of ceiling temperatures that would be encountered in practice in such combination environments. There was a slight trend for the reported sensation of ‘freshness’ to increase as ceiling temperature was reduced though this requires further study. It is concluded that existing guidance regarding toleration of radiant asymmetry is valid for thermal comfort design of chilled ceiling/displacement ventilation environments},

	abstract = {The near zone of supply air diffusers is very critical for the indoor climate. Complaints of draft are often associated with low-velocity diffusers in displacement ventilation because the air is discharged directly into the occupied zone. Today, the knowledge of the near zone of these air supply diffusers is insufficient, causing an increased need for better measuring methods and representation of the occupied zone. A whole-field measuring technique has been developed by the authors for visualization of air temperatures and airflow patterns over a large cross-section. In this particular whole-field method, air temperatures are measured with an infrared camera and a measuring screen placed in the airflow. The technique is applicable to most laboratory and field test environments. It offers several advantages over traditional techniques; for example, it can record real-time images within large areas and capture transient events. The purpose of this study was to conduct a parameter and error analysis of the proposed whole-field measuring method applied to a flow from a low-velocity diffuser in displacement ventilation. A model of the energy balance, for a solid measuring screen, was used for analyzing the influence of different parameters on the accuracy of the method. The analysis was performed with respect to the convective heat transfer coefficient, emissivity, screen temperature and surrounding surface temperatures. Theoretically, the temperature difference between the screen and the ambient air was found to be 0.2–2.4°C for the specific delimitation in the investigation. However, after applying correction the maximum uncertainty of the predicted air temperature was found to vary between 0.62 and 0.98°C, due to uncertainties in estimating parameters used in the correction. The maximum uncertainty can be reduced to a great extent by estimating the convective heat transfer coefficient more accurately and using a screen with rather low emissivity.},

Acquisition of sensor data of a building is essential to ensure the improvement of the indoor thermal environment for the occupants. The environmental sensor technologies together with Building Information Modeling ({BIM}) are tools for assessing/analyzing the performance of a building. Although {BIM} has a potential to verify thermal performance by using a {BIM} database, integrating the surface-heat of building envelopes and sensing data has not been fully explored in the existing {BIM}. {BIM} requires tools to enable building professionals to effectively detect the location of thermal defects and analyze the thermal performance and indoor thermal comfort by accommodating environmental information to be used in the analysis process. Therefore, this research presents a novel method for integrating time-stamped 3D thermal data in the {BIM}. In the proposed method, the {BIM} model is integrated with spatio-temporal thermal and air temperature data. Visual scripting is used for extracting and then mapping spatio-temporal thermal data to a 3D {BIM} model. The proposed system converts the collected thermal images into numeric surface temperatures, integrates collected environmental data in the {BIM}, calculates thermal comfort variables, such as mean radiant temperature ({MRT}), and assesses the thermal comfort level for various locations inside the building. The applicability of the proposed method is validated in a real-world case study. The developed prototype system provides valuable visualization information and statistical data for analyzing thermal performance and assessing the thermal comfort level.},

One is based on morphology and is computationally efficient, while the other is based on spatial isotropic wavelets and is flexible; both require the support of a reliable facial tracker. We validated the two algorithms against the clinical standard in a controlled lab experiment where orienting responses were invoked on n=18 subjects via auditory stimuli. Then, we used the validated algorithms to quantify stress of surgeons (n=24) as they were performing suturing drills during inanimate laparoscopic training. This is a field application where the new methodology shines. It allows nonobtrusive monitoring of individuals who are naturally challenged with a task that is localized in space and requires directional attention. Both algorithms associate high stress levels with novice surgeons, while low stress levels are associated with experienced surgeons, raising the possibility for an affective measure (stress) to assist in efficacy determination. It is a clear indication of the methodology's promise and potential.},

	abstract = {To study the reliability of formulas for calculating mean skin temperature (Tsk), values were computed by 18 different techniques and were compared with the mean of 10,841 skin temperatures measured by infrared thermography. One hundred whole-body infrared thermograms were scanned in ten resting males while changing the air temperature from 40 degrees C to 4 degrees C. Local, regional average and mean skin temperatures were obtained using an image processing system. The agreement frequency, defined as the percentage of the calculated Tsk values which agreed with the corresponding infrared thermographic Tsk within +/- 0.2 degree C, ranged for with the various formulas from 7\% to 80\%. In many sites, the local skin temperature did not coincide with the regional average skin temperature. When the local skin temperatures which showed the highest percentage similarity to the regional average skin temperature within +/- 0.4 degree C were applied to the formula, the agreement frequency was markedly improved for all formulas. However, the agreement frequency was not affected by changing the weighting factors from specific constants to individually measured values of regional surface area. By applying the physiologically reliable accuracy range of +/- 0.2 degree C in the moderate and +/- 0.4 degree C in the cool condition, agreement frequencies of at least 95\% were observed in formulas involving seven or more skin temperature measurement sites, including the hand and foot. We conclude that calculation of a reliable mean skin temperature must involve more than seven skin temperature measurement sites regardless of ambient temperature. Optimal sites for skin temperature measurement are proposed for various formulas.},

In this paper, we present a method to quantify the reflected flux by using an infrared mirror, which allows large surface temperature measurements by infrared thermography under near-ambient conditions with improved accuracy. In order to validate the method, an experimental study was carried out on a multi-layer wall, which simulated an insulation default. A good agreement was noticed between the thermocouple temperatures and the infrared corrected ones. Then, the method is applied to outdoor measurements.},

	abstract = {We present a new tool of measurement and visualization of the indoor ambient parameters (air temperature, air speed, and mean radiant temperature) by infrared thermography. The theoretical fundamentals are discussed. They include a design stage, the mathematical modeling, the measurement procedure, and the performance evaluation through error analysis. The measuring system consists of a set of auxiliary devices (targets) arranged on a measurement grid. An infrared camera measures their temperature histories. From each temperature chronology, the three ambient parameters are locally deduced together by solving an inverse heat transfer problem. The results are then mapped to provide a 2D or 3D visualization. The question of identifiability is addressed leading to a robust parameter estimation algorithm. The robustness of the algorithm is tested for a wide range of noisy data during a numerical experiment. The numerical data are built by varying the air speed from 0 ms−1 to 2 ms−1 with a step of 0.2 ms−1, the air temperature from 15 °C to 30 °C with a step of 3 °C and the mean radiant temperature from 15 °C to 30 °C with a step of 3 °C. It appears that stability and repeatability are guaranteed by the presented method for the range of ambient parameters and accuracy usually found and needed in indoor conditions. Brief illustrative experimental results are given as an initial validation of the method. Since the spatial distributions of these ambient parameters are obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, the method is suitable for indoor microclimate mapping, visualization of air patterns, building inspection, thermal comfort assessment, etc.},

In order to verify the conformance of comfort indices measured by means of different measurement techniques and devices, some experimental tests in three typical environments have been carried out: (i) residential, (ii) office, and (iii) industrial. To highlight both the compatibility of measurement and the suitability, tests were carried out using three special comfort-analysis data-loggers, each provided with different sensors characterized by different instrumental uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Accurately assessing the physiological status of firefighters during work in the heat is critical to ensuring their safety. Evaluating core temperatures (Tc) in the field is problematic due to cost and limitations in technology and accuracy. As such, fire services rely on individual perceptions of wellbeing. The present study aimed to establish whether perceptual responses measured using the perceptual strain index ({PeSI}), calculated from rate of perceived exertion ({RPE}) and thermal sensation ({TS}), could reliably predict the physiological strain ({PSI}) encountered by experienced firefighters working in a hot environment. We conducted two firefighting simulations (set-pace and self-paced) in a purposefully built heat chamber (100 ± 5°C) comprised of two 20-min periods separated by a 10-min recovery outside the chamber. Physiological strain was measured via heart rate ({HR}) and gastrointestinal temperature (Tgi) and compared with {PeSI} at 5-min intervals. To evaluate the predictive ability of the {PeSI} for {PSI}, mean differences and the 95\% limits of agreement ({LOA}) were established, along with correlation coefficients at each 5-min interval. Moderately significant correlations occurred in the second work bout of the self-paced trial only (10 min: r = 0.335, 15 min: r = 0.498, 20 min r = 0.439) with no other correlations observed at any other time during either trial or during the rest periods. Bland-Altman analysis revealed mean differences of −0.74 ± 2.70 (self-paced) and +0.04 ± 2.04 (set-paced) between {PeSI} and {PSI} with the 95\% {LOA} being −4.77 to 3.28 (self-paced) and −4.01 to 2.01 (set-paced). The wide {LOA} and lack of correlations observed between perceptual and physiological strain in both self-paced and set-paced work trials indicate that {PeSI} is not sufficiently reliable as a sole measure of wellbeing for firefighters working in the heat. Hence, we recommend that fire services prioritise the development of reliable and effective monitoring tools for use in the field.},

	abstract = {An ingestible telemetric temperature sensor for measuring body core temperature (Tc) was first described 45 years ago, although the method has only recently gained widespread use for exercise applications. This review aims to (1) use Bland and Altman's limits of agreement ({LoA}) method as a basis for quantitatively reviewing the agreement between intestinal sensor temperature (Tintestinal), oesophageal temperature (Toesophageal) and rectal temperature (Trectal) across numerous previously published validation studies; (2) review factors that may affect agreement; and (3) review the application of this technology in field-based exercise studies. The agreement between Tintestinal and Toesophageal is suggested to meet our delimitation for an acceptable level of agreement (ie, systematic bias {\textless}0.1 degrees C and 95\% {LoA} within +/-0.4 degrees C). The agreement between Tintestinal and Trectal shows a significant systematic bias {\textgreater}0.1 degrees C, although the 95\% {LoA} is acceptable. Tintestinal responds less rapidly than Toesophageal at the start or cessation of exercise or to a change in exercise intensity, but more rapidly than Trectal. When using this technology, care should be taken to ensure adequate control over sensor calibration and data correction, timing of ingestion and electromagnetic interference. The ingestible sensor has been applied successfully in numerous sport and occupational applications such as the continuous measurement of Tc in deep sea saturation divers, distance runners and soldiers undertaking sustained military training exercises. It is concluded that the ingestible telemetric temperature sensor represents a valid index of Tc and shows excellent utility for ambulatory field-based applications.},

Eight well-trained, male cyclists completed two 60 min self-paced cycling bouts during which they completed as much work as possible. Using a liquid-perfused suit, skin temperature (T (Sk)) was changed during the two trials such that T (Sk) either started hot and was cooled (H to C) or started cold and was heated (C to H) throughout exercise. Pre-exercise core temperatures (T (C)) and heart rates ({HR}) were similar between trials, while T (Sk), thermal comfort and thermal sensation were higher in H to C. The change in T (Sk) was similar in magnitude during the two trials. Work completed was greatest in C to H, which was attributed to a higher initial power output. T (C) was similar between trials. {HR} was similar until 35 min had elapsed, after which it became lower in H to C. The perception of effort increased similarly between the two trials, while thermal comfort and thermal sensation generally reflected the changes observed in T (Sk). These results indicate that upon exercise commencement T (Sk) and the accompanying thermal perceptions are important inputs in the initial selection of exercise intensity.},

In particular for larger plants (commercial {GSHP} or {UTES}), the thermal conductivity should be measured on site. A useful tool to do so is a thermal response test, carried out on a borehole heat exchanger in a pilot borehole (later to be part of the borehole field). For a thermal response test, basically a defined heat load is injected into the {BHE}, and the resulting temperature changes of the circulating fluid are measured. The paper includes a short description of the basic concept and the theory behind the thermal response test, reviews shortly the world-wide uptake and experience of this technology, and gives the main emphasis on the experience in routine operation of the test, and on the economic reasons for testing.},

	abstract = {Demand-driven control of building heating, ventilation and air conditioning ({HVAC}) and lighting systems warrants an attractive energy saving potential. A reliable and accurate occupancy detection technique should be available for estimating the demand. To this, many occupancy detection methods have been developed either based on physical sensors, cameras or information \& communication technology ({ICT}). Wi-Fi based detection is one of the {ICTs} that uses Wi-Fi signals (e.g. from smartphones) to represent occupants. Nowadays, new smartphone models all have the battery-saving function that will switch off Wi-Fi communication in the idle mode, causing significant detection uncertainties. This challenge has not been addressed in the current Wi-Fi based occupancy detection methods that still assume or manipulate a continuous Wi-Fi communication. Moreover, most studies are conducted in relatively simple settings with small-scale occupancy that are far from a complex indoor space. Thus, this study investigates the Wi-Fi based occupancy detection in a complex indoor space with large occupancy. An event-triggered updating method is proposed to cater for the discontinuity in Wi-Fi communication of the smartphones. A location filter and a non-human media access control ({MAC}) address filter are proposed to screen out irrelevant Wi-Fi devices. The proposed event-triggered updating method is able to improve the detection accuracy from 77.3\% to 96.8\%. The proposed location filter and non-human {MAC} address filter prove to be effective in removing irrelevant outside and non-human devices. The proposed event-triggered updating method can be applied to existing installations with minimum cost regardless of the Wi-Fi communication continuity.},

Current techniques, however, do not provide an adequate solution for efficient thermostat control, because they require costly infrastructures to detect occupancy or because they inaccurately predict the occupancy due to irregular patterns. In this paper, we propose an automatic thermostat control system based on the mobility prediction of users, using contextual information obtained by mobile phones. We also present an arrival time prediction scheme that combines both historical pattern and route classification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system can successfully predict at least 70\% of the transit cases within 10 minutes' error and can decrease energy consumption by 26\%.},

	abstract = {We conducted a field study in a deep-plan office building equipped with suspended direct-indirect luminaires located centrally in cubicle workstations. In order to reduce lighting energy use, the luminaires employed integral occupancy sensors and light sensors (daylight harvesting), as well as individual dimming control accessed through occupants' computer screens. Data were collected from 86 workstations over a year to examine the energy savings and power reduction attributable to the controls, and how the controls were used. An awareness campaign that used e-mail reminders to encourage the occupants to use the individual control feature of the lighting system was also conducted. Results indicate that the lighting system generated substantial energy savings and peak power reductions compared to a conventional fluorescent lighting system installed on a neighboring floor. The installed lighting power was 42 percent lower than that of the conventional system. The three controls combined saved 42 to 47 percent in lighting energy use compared to the same lights used at full power during work-hours; this translated into overall savings of 67 to 69 percent compared to the conventional lighting system. If the three lighting controls systems had been installed separately, occupancy sensors would have saved, on average, 35 percent if used alone, light sensors (daylight harvesting) 20 percent, and individual dimming 11 percent. The light sensor savings were, as expected, higher in perimeter workstations, and would have matched the performance of the occupancy sensors with some modifications to the control parameters. The average daily peak power demand for lighting was also reduced by a similar amount, which resulted in an average effective lighting power density of only 3 W/m2. Although not detailed in this paper, surveys indicated that the studied lighting system was also associated with higher occupant satisfaction. This was likely due to the individual dimming control, although use of this control beyond an initial preferred setting was rare.},

As far as the lighting services are concerned, control systems offer an important opportunity of managing lighting systems and reducing energy consumption, due to the use of integration strategies between daylight and electric lighting and strategies based on the occupancy of spaces. The results of an experimental case study of ten offices in Torino (Italy), in which a custom-design building automation and control system has been designed to control both the lighting plants and the air conditioning system, are presented in this paper. The study was carried out in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of the lighting control system and to analyse the environmental luminous conditions obtained through the application of this technology to a real case. The environmental and energy performances, together with the degree of users' satisfaction and acceptance of this control system, were analysed after a year of activity to verify the potentiality and operation of this lighting control system. The obtained results regarding the potential energy savings (from 17\% to 32\%) were evaluated taking into account both the monitored annual electric energy consumption (for operation) and the parasitic energy consumption due to the installed devices (luminaire ballasts, sensors and controllers), and were compared with the estimated energy consumption calculated applying the method proposed in the European standard {EN} 15193:2007.},

In this work, we present several methods of feedback that use data presentation and environmental interaction in comfort voting applications. Through a 40 week user study of 61 University employees across 3 buildings, we show that feedback systems can be used to increase user satisfaction with thermal conditions from 33.9\% to 93.3\% and reduce energy consumption up to 18.99\% compared to a system without voting. In addition, we find that by including a drifting control strategy, we find energy savings up to 37\% can be realized without a significant reduction in satisfaction.},

Lack of information about human related variables results in using unrepresentative operational settings, which in turn could bring about low efficiency in {HVAC} operations. In this paper, the implementation and evaluation of a framework that integrates building occupants’ personalized thermal profiles into the {HVAC} control logic is presented. The framework enables occupants to communicate their preferences for indoor thermal conditions through a user interface, leveraging a participatory sensing approach. The framework learns occupants’ comfort profiles, using a fuzzy predictive model, and controls the {HVAC} system using a complementary control strategy, which enables the framework to be implemented in existing centrally controlled {HVAC} systems with minimum intrusion. Evaluation of the framework in a real building setting showed user comfort improvement. Moreover, the results showed a 39\% reduction in daily average airflow when the {HVAC} system conditions the rooms at occupants’ desired temperatures. Airflow is proportional to the energy consumption of {HVAC} system components. Consequently, the implementation of the framework shows improvements in the efficiency of the {HVAC} system's performance for centrally controlled office buildings.},

Of this total, 50\% of the energy consumed in buildings is used for Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning ({HVAC}) systems. Current {HVAC} systems only condition based on static schedules; rooms are conditioned regardless of occupancy. By conditioning rooms only when necessary, greater efficiency can be achieved. This paper describes {POEM}, a complete closed-loop system for optimally controlling {HVAC} systems in buildings based on actual occupancy levels. {POEM} is comprised of multiple parts. A wireless network of cameras called {OPTNet} is developed that functions as an optical turnstile to measure area/zone occupancies. Another wireless sensor network of passive infrared ({PIR}) sensors called {BONet} functions alongside {OPTNet}. This sensed occupancy data from both systems are then fused with an occupancy prediction model using a particle filter in order to determine the most accurate current occupancy in each zone in the building. Finally, the information from occupancy prediction models and current occupancy is combined in order to find the optimal conditioning strategy required to reach target temperatures and minimize ventilation requirements. Based on live tests of the system, we estimate {\textasciitilde}30.0\% energy saving can be achieved while still maintaining thermal comfort.},

It saves energy by relaxing ambient temperature requirements for the {HVAC} system. Aside from these benefits, {PCS} offers a wealth of data that can describe how individuals interact with heating/cooling devices in their own environment. Recently developed Internet-connected {PCS} chairs have unlocked this opportunity by generating continuous streams of heating and cooling usage data, along with occupancy status and environmental measurements via embedded sensors. The data allow individuals' comfort and behavior to be learned, and can inform centralized systems to provide ‘just the right’ amount of conditioning to meet occupant needs. In summer 2016, we carried out a study with {PCS} chairs involving 37 occupants in an office building in California. During the study period, we collected {\textgreater}5 million chair usage data-points and 4500 occupant survey responses, as well as continuous measurements of environmental and {HVAC} system conditions. The data analysis shows that (1) local temperatures experienced by individual occupants vary quite widely across different parts of the building, even within the same thermal zone; (2) occupants often have different thermal preferences even under the same thermal conditions; (3) {PCS} control behavior can dynamically describe individuals' thermal preferences; (4) {PCS} chairs produce much higher comfort satisfaction (96\%) than typically achieved in buildings. We conclude that {PCS} not only provide personalized comfort solutions but also offer individualized feedback that can improve comfort analytics and control decisions in buildings.},

Lighting controllers that integrate occupancy and luminosity sensors to improve energy efficiency have been proposed. However, they are often ineffective because they focus solely on energy consumption rather than providing comfort to the occupants. An ideal controller should adapt itself to the preferences of the occupant and the environmental conditions. In this article, we introduce {LightLearn}, an occupant centered controller ({OCC}) for lighting based on Reinforcement Learning ({RL}). We describe the theory and hardware implementation of {LightLearn}. Our experiment during eight weeks in five offices shows that {LightLearn} learns the individual occupant behaviors and indoor environmental conditions, and adapts its control parameters accordingly by determining personalized set-points. Participants reported that the overall lighting was slightly improved compared to prior lighting conditions. We compare {LightLearn} to schedule-based and occupancy-based control scenarios, and evaluate their performance with respect to total energy use, light-utilization-ratio, unmet comfort hours, as well as light-comfort-ratio, which we introduce in this paper. We show that only {LightLearn} balances successfully occupant comfort and energy consumption. The adaptive nature of {LightLearn} suggests that reinforcement learning based occupant centered control is a viable approach to mitigate the discrepancy between occupant comfort and the goals of building control.},

This makes office buildings a target for occupant-driven demand control measures, which have been demonstrated as having huge potential to improve energy efficiency. The application of occupant-driven demand control measures in buildings, most especially in the control of thermal, visual and indoor air quality providing systems, which account for over 30\% of the energy consumed in a typical office building is however hampered due to the lack of comprehensive fine-grained occupancy information. Given that comprehensive fine-grained occupancy information improves the performance of demand-driven measures, this paper presents a review of common existing systems utilized in buildings for occupancy detection. Furthermore, experimental results from the performance evaluation of chair sensors in an office building for providing fine-grained occupancy information for demand-driven control applications are presented.},

The authors observed that the occupants interact with their thermostats infrequently (on average once every 56 h of occupancy); and when they did so, occupants changed the temperature set-point, on average, by 1°C. The authors observed that about one-third of the thermostat overrides were either to decrease the set-points during the heating season, or to increase the set-points during the cooling season. The temperatures leading to the thermostat overrides changed by ∼3°C seasonally. It was noted that the frequency of thermostat interactions can be approximated as a univariate logistic regression model that inputs the indoor temperature as the predictor variable. A recursive algorithm was formulated to develop univariate thermostat use models inside building controllers. It was implemented inside four commercial controllers serving seven private office spaces to choose operating set-points. One year after the implementation, the iterative learning process resulted in a 2°C–3°C reduction in the set-points during the heating season and a 2°C–3°C increase in the set-points during the cooling season with respect to the default 22°C set-point in both seasons.},

This model quantitatively predicts human comfort based on a set of underlying measurable environmental and personal parameters. {SPOT} uses a set of sensors, including a Microsoft Kinect, to measure the parameters underlying the {PPV} model, then controls heating and cooling elements to dynamically adjust indoor temperature to maintain comfort. Based on a deployment of {SPOT} in a real office environment, we find that {SPOT} can accurately maintain personal comfort despite environmental fluctuations and allows a worker to balance personal comfort with energy use.},

This is established from measurements of a host of environmental variables and analysis of before-after occupant survey results. We present a complete system to retrofit existing buildings including the control algorithm and the supporting execution platform which includes the deployment of a wireless sensor network. Results show that there is a large variation in energy savings from zone to zone, which indicates that estimating energy savings potential of novel {HVAC} control systems is not trivial even from experiments-something that prior work with uniformly positive messages did not emphasize.},

	abstract = {This study describes an innovative occupancy and chilled-water storage-based operation sequence implemented in a solar-assisted air-conditioning system. The core purpose of this solar-assisted air-conditioning system is to handle the cooling and heating load of the Solar Energy Research Centre ({CIESOL}), thus minimising its environmental impact. In this study, the cooling mode was investigated with special attention focused on the chilled-water storage circuit. The critical concern is that the solar-assisted air-conditioning system should always operate considering the actual load conditions, not using an abstract maximum load that is predetermined during the system’s design process, which can lead to energy waste during periods of low occupancy. Thus, the fundamental problem is to identify the optimum operation sequence for the solar-assisted air-conditioning system that provides the best energy performance. The significance of this work lies in the demonstration of a new operation strategy that utilises real-time occupancy monitoring and chilled-water storage tanks to improve the efficiency of solar-assisted air-conditioning systems, thereby reducing their electricity consumption. Adopting this strategy resulted in a large energy-saving potential. The results demonstrate that during one cooling period, it is possible to conserve approximately 42\% of the total electrical energy consumed by the system prior to the adoption of this operation strategy.},

In this article, we present {WinLight}, a novel occupancy-driven lighting control system that aims to reduce energy consumption while simultaneously preserving the lighting comfort of occupants. By leveraging the fine-grained occupancy information estimated by existing {WiFi} infrastructure in a non-intrusive manner, {WinLight} computes an appropriate dimming command for each lamp based on a novel lighting control algorithm. A centralized lighting control system assigns these commands to a zonal gateway, and occupancy-driven lighting control is achieved by actuating the brightness adjustment with a local controller integrated within each lamp. Moreover, a {WinLight} App is designed to enable occupants to customize their luminance preferences and to control nearby lamps using their mobile devices. We implemented {WinLight} in a 1500m2 multi-functional office in Singapore and conducted an experiment during 24 weeks. The experimental results demonstrate that {WinLight} achieves 93.09\% and 80.27\% energy savings compared to static scheduling lighting control scheme and {PIR} sensor based lighting control scheme while guaranteeing the personalized lighting comfort of each occupant.},

In commercial buildings, {HVAC} setpoints are set according to average comfort temperatures. However, individual temperature preferences may be different. The purpose of this study is to explore the means of making {HVAC} systems respond automatically to local occupant temperature preferences. To create an occupant-centric indoor temperature environment, we propose an online-learning-based control strategy together with its design process. Four essential variables from four domains—time, indoor and outdoor climates, and occupant behavior—are extracted to construct datasets for preference models. A neural network algorithm and corresponding hyperparameters are suggested to model temperature preferences. According to time-dependent setpoints learned from dynamic contexts, a set of specified rules is used to determine setpoints for {HVAC} systems. For a period of five months, the resulting learning-based temperature preference control ({LTPC}) was applied to a cooling system of an office space under real-world conditions. The four case study rooms consisted of typical office uses: single-person and multi-person offices. The experimental results indicate that occupant preferences in the individual rooms differ from each other in both time horizon and temperature levels. The results report energy savings of between 4\% and 25\% as compared to static temperature setpoints at the low values of preferred temperature ranges. Meanwhile, during {LPTC}, the need for occupant interventions for adjusting room temperatures to fit their preferences was reduced from four to nine weekdays a month to a maximum of one weekday a month.},

	abstract = {Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning ({HVAC}) are among the major energy demand in the buildings sector globally. Improving the energy efficiency of such systems is a critical objective for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning towards renewable sources of energy supply. The interest of this paper is to explore means to increase the efficiency of {HVAC} systems in accommodating occupants’ behavior in real time. For instance, rooms in office buildings are not always occupied by occupants during scheduled {HVAC} service periods. This offers an opportunity to reduce unnecessary energy demands of {HVAC} systems associated with occupants’ behavior. An in-depth analysis of occupants’ stochastic behavior within an office building is conducted in this paper. A demand-driven control strategy is proposed that automatically responds to occupants’ energy-related behavior for reducing energy consumption and maintains room temperature for occupants with similar performances as a static cooling. In this control strategy, two types of machine learning methods – unsupervised and supervised learning – are applied to learn occupants’ behavior in two learning processes. The occupancy-related information learned by the algorithms is used by a set of specified rules to infer real-time room setpoints for controlling the office's space cooling system. This learning-based approach intends to reduce the need for human intervention in the cooling system’s control. The proposed strategy was applied to control the cooling system of the office building under real-world conditions. Eleven case study office spaces were selected, representing three typical office uses: single person offices, multi-person offices, and meeting rooms. The experimental results report between 7\% and 52\% energy savings as compared to the conventionally-scheduled cooling systems.},

The practical situation does not allow controlling end-units in the different zones of the building. The {MPC} makes use of a Modelica grey-box control model resulting from a system identification with monitoring data. The paper covers the monitoring, model identification, forecasting of disturbances, state estimation, formulation and solving of the optimal control problem ({OCP}) and transmission of the control signals. The performance is evaluated on a daily basis based on analysis of heating degree days, thermal comfort, energy costs and primary energy consumption. The results show that the model predictive controller is able to provide a similar or better thermal comfort than the reference control while reducing the energy costs by more than 30\%. This is due among others, to a better use of the heat pumps and an adapted hot water supply temperature.},

Workstation-based wireless photosensors are employed to measure task illuminance, and individual addressability of wireless-enabled dimmable luminaires increases the freedom of the lighting system to fulfil various lighting requirements. Daylight harvesting, occupancy control and light level tuning strategies are formulated into an optimisation problem that generates light outputs for each luminaire to produce the desired lighting at each workstation with minimal energy usage. A pilot study of the wireless-networked lighting system implemented in a small open-plan office has shown more than 60\% energy savings potential compared to conventional practice without any control.},

The study took place in 86 cubicles in an open office with low levels of daylight. A direct/indirect pendant luminaire with three 32 watt lamps, two {DALI} ballasts, and an occupancy sensor provided both task and ambient light for each cubicle. All three lamps turned on and off according to occupancy on a workstation-by-workstation basis. Field measurements taken over the course of several months demonstrated 40 percent lighting energy savings compared to a baseline that represents a typical Federal building retrofit; the baseline has a lighting power density of 8.9W/m2 (0.83W/ft2) and no advanced controls. A photometric analysis found that the installation provided higher desktop light levels than the baseline did, while an occupant survey suggested that occupants preferred the lighting system to the baseline.This document was prepared as an account of work sponsored by the United States Government.

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the application of sensor networks to lighting control, and had two goals. The first goal was to evaluate the utility of using more than one sensor to detect occupancy. Sensor networks were installed in a sample of private offices and cubicle workstations. Large individual differences in sensor response to occupancy were observed in all monitored areas: the percent difference in occupied time measured by sensors in ten private offices ranged from 16.1 percent to 74.0 percent (mean 44.7 percent): the differences between detectors measuring occupancy in 23 cubicle workstations ranged from 14 percent to 91 percent (mean 53.7 percent). These data establish the considerable uncertainty in occupancy measurement that exists with current systems. Current control systems compensate for this uncertainty by applying a long time delay before switching lights off. Since a sensor network more accurately measures occupancy, shorter time delays can be applied to reduce system operating time and save energy. Applying a 5-minute time delay to sensor network data, instead of the 20 minutes that is more typical in current single sensor applications, reduced operating time by an additional 22.4 percent to 33.3 percent (relative to the reductions that would have resulted from use of a single sensor). A longer time delay of 10 minutes applied to the sensor network data stream produced reductions of 8.4 percent to 24.7 percent, relative to the reduction that would have resulted from use of a single sensor with a 20-minute time delay.},

	abstract = {Occupancy sensors have long been used for control of various devices (like artificial light, {HVAC} devices, etc.). Past research has shown that use of occupancy sensors for control of lighting can save up to 30\% electrical energy used for lighting. However, most of the sensors, which are currently being put to use, have a preset (sometimes user adjustable) time delay ({TD}) (the time after which the lights or any other load will be switched “off” after the last motion is detected by the sensor). If this {TD} is long then, it will have less energy savings, as the load will remain “on” during unoccupied period also. At the same time, if the {TD} is kept short then it may result in unwanted switching “off” (False Off) of the lights when no motion is detected during periods of occupancy. It has been observed in our research that the activity level of a user changes over the time of the day. Also, it is seen that activity level of different users is different. Hence, single {TD} for all the users and for all times of the day is not desirable. The commonly used sensors do not adapt to changing activity levels. In this paper, we present design of smart occupancy sensors which can adapt to changing activity levels. A model is also proposed for “human movement” of a person working at a computer. Smart occupancy sensor can learn the variation in activity level of the occupants with respect to time of the day. With this information, it can change the {TD} with time of the day. Experiments conducted have shown that about 5\% more energy can be saved by using smart occupancy sensor as compared to non-adapting fixed {TD} sensors.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in information and communication technology have sparked the notion of smart buildings; an example of which is occupant-centric control ({OCC}). In this approach, a control system acquires various data from occupants, the indoor environment, and outdoor climate, and learns or derives useful information for building control, e.g., room occupancy patterns and adaptive set-points. Ultimately, these adaptive control parameters are used to improve both occupant comfort and energy efficiency. Typical {OCC} approaches have been put forward in concept papers, small-scale experiments, as well as simulations. However, there are relatively few studies in which {OCC} is implemented in real buildings. In this article, we review {OCC} research, focusing on field-implementation case studies in actual buildings under realistic use conditions. First, we analyze the topical aspects of these studies, e.g., building types, location, and building systems. Next, we present a methodological review focusing on the different approaches used to implement {OCC} in existing building systems. Lastly, we investigate the experimental design approach of the reviewed case studies, focusing on measurement and verification techniques. Results highlight wide discrepancies in the implementation approach of {OCC} case studies and identify common challenges facing {OCC} in actual buildings. We propose future directions for {OCC} research by providing recommendations to address these challenges and to standardize {OCC} implementations.},

A typical experiment was found to employ 25 subjects and to take place in a permanent climate chamber with a floor area of 24m2 During the experiment, 3 air temperature variations are used. The test itself takes 115min, but is preceded by a preconditioning and conditioning phase. The subject is given a questionnaire at regular intervals of 15min, with questions highly dependent on topic, but including thermal sensation and comfort vote rated on a bipolar 7-level scale. Number of subjects, gender distribution, type and floor area of the climate chamber and utilization rate of the scale for rating thermal comfort and sensation are all linked to topic, as well as number of different air temperatures, whether conditioning is employed and questions in the questionnaire.

	abstract = {Buildings have a major contribution to the global energy consumption. Heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems ({HVAC}) are responsible for most of the energy use in buildings. Thus, clean and sustainable alternatives such as free cooling of buildings have recently gained much attention as means to reduce the operation hours and capacity of the conventional cooling and heating systems. The free cooling could be provided by collecting the natural cold energy during night time in appropriate thermal storage form and this could be retrieved when needed. Phase change materials are exploited by a number of investigators as a storage medium in free cooling applications, as these substances possess high energy densities, and absorb and release heat at a narrow temperature range, hence, the comfort temperature can be maintained day and night. The objectives of this article are to provide a comprehensive review on recent development on free cooling technologies incorporating latent heat storage and to shit lights on the most significant parameters affecting the performance of these materials in free cooling strategy. The outcomes of this review would be helpful in providing clear insight information on potential improvements that can be applied to the storage materials. All the reviewed studies demonstrated that the night cooling strategy using {PCMs} has the capacity to maintain the indoor temperature well within the comfort zone whilst providing a considerable reduction in cooling loads in all considered climates.},

After explaining its historical growth, the applicability of passive and active approaches has been described, considering well-established and emerging techniques, general procedures, types of {IR}-camera used, technical issues, and limitations. The passive approach is the most common to detect thermally significant defects. Thus, a specific procedure for the energy audit has been reported, matching different standards, guidelines, and professional advice. Similarly, recurring energy related problems are toughly presented (i.e. thermal characterization of buildings; thermal bridging, insulation level, air leakage and moisture detection; indoor temperature and U-value measurements; human comfort assessment). Finally, advantages and potential sources of errors as well as future trends in the use of {IRT} for the energy audit have been described.

	abstract = {Measurement uncertainty is a key component in the overall uncertainty calculation for Measurement and Verification (M\&V) projects. However, in some cases, it is reduced to outlier detection or basic uncertainty propagation calculations. In other cases, funds are spent on determining uncertainties that have little effect on project decisions. Therefore a need exists for a fuller treatment of the subject in the light of literature from M\&V and other fields. This paper surveys general M\&V literature, as well as relevant research from metrology, electrical engineering, economics, decision analysis, and statistics. Electrical metering and sub-metering uncertainty is investigated, as well as often-overlooked considerations such as power quality and the cost of calibration. The effect of mismeasurement on energy models and practical techniques for mitigating such effects are assessed. Last, research on building simulation and project decisions in the light of measurement error is surveyed. Bayesian methods are found to be a recurring theme in much of the research being conducted on all of these aspects. Power quality and mismeasurement effects have also been found to make a material difference in project evaluation. The survey is concluded with recommendations for further research in the light of current trends in data analysis and energy evaluation.},

Reducing energy demand through optimal operation is the subject of building control research, while human satisfaction in buildings is studied in the thermal comfort community. Thus, balancing the two is necessary for a sustainable and comfortable building stock. We review both research fields and their relationship using a data-driven approach. Based on specific search terms, all relevant abstracts from the Web Of Science database are downloaded and analyzed using the text mining software {VOSviewer}. We visualize the scientific landscapes of historic and recent trends, and analyze the citation network to investigate the interaction between thermal comfort and building control research. We find that building control focuses predominantly on energy savings rather than incorporating results from thermal comfort, especially when it comes to occupant satisfaction. We identify potential research directions in terms of bridging the two fields.},

We have re-evaluated, by review of the literature, how low relative humidity ({RH}) may influence the immediately perceived indoor air quality ({IAQ}), including odour, and cause irritation symptoms (i.e. longer-term perceived {IAQ}). “Relative humidity” were searched in major databases, and combined with: air quality, cabin air, dry eyes, formaldehyde, inflammation, mucous membranes, offices, ozone, pungency, sensory irritation, particles, precorneal tear film, sick building syndrome, stuffy air, and {VOCs}. The impact of {RH} on the immediately and longer-term perceived {IAQ} by {VOCs}, ozone, and particles is complex, because both the thermodynamic condition and the emission characteristics of building materials are influenced. Epidemiological, clinical, and human exposure studies indicate that low {RH} plays a role in the increase of reporting eye irritation symptoms and alteration of the precorneal tear film. These effects may be exacerbated during visual display unit work. The recommendation that {IAQ} should be “dry and cool” may be useful for evaluation of the immediately perceived {IAQ} in material emission testing, but should be considered cautiously about the development of irritation symptoms in eyes and upper airways during a workday. Studies indicate that {RH} about 40\% is better for the eyes and upper airways than levels below 30\%. The optimal {RH} may differ for the eyes and the airways regarding desiccation of the mucous membranes.},

Heating, ventilating and air-conditioning ({HVAC}) system constitutes 40\% of the total energy consumption in a typical commercial building. While the main objective of {HVAC} is to provide occupants with a comfort and safe environment, it currently lacks channels to recognize occupants' favourite temperatures as well as reflect their levels of comfort, e.g., too-cold or too-hot. Hence, it is hard to justify the energy consumption without considering end-user needs. Models of thermal comfort and predicted mean vote have been used to estimate such index, however, they are not widely adopted due to their complexity and inaccuracy. In this paper, we design the innovative system {CarryEn}, which first captures user's favourite temperature non-intrusively from their daily environment. We connect our system with the building management system ({BMS}), and optimize the setpoint temperature to occupants with our model. When the user moves into other rooms or buildings, his favourite setting will also be carried with him. Based on our experiments, {CarryEn} is able to achieve an improvement of 28.2\% thermal satisfaction from occupants and save 13\% of energy consumption.},

In this paper, we explore the influence of indoor thermal experience on occupants' thermal adaptation, especially with regard to physiological adaptation.

A comparative experiment, including both physiological measurements and subjective questionnaires, was conducted in China where winter indoor climates in the northern region (with pervasive district heating) are much warmer than the southern region (without district heating). Two subject groups were recruited, namely: (a) N–N group - subjects who had lived in the northern China with district heating all their life, and (b) S–N group - subjects who grew up in the southern region without district heating but recently moved to the north. The results indicate that S–N subjects who had lived their entire lives in cold wintertime indoor climates had slither physiological response and felt less uncomfortable in mild cold exposures than N–N subjects who lived in neutral-to-warm wintertime indoor climates. The findings suggest that indoor thermal exposures can also influence occupants' thermal adaptation, which can reserve as a reference to the future adaptive thermal comfort model.},

	abstract = {Measurements of skin temperatures are often complicated because of the use of wired sensors. This is so in field studies, but also holds for many laboratory conditions. This article describes a wireless temperature system for human skin temperature measurements, i.e. the Thermochron {iButton} {DS}1291H. The study deals with validation of the {iButton} and its application on the human skin, and describes clinical and field measurements. The validation study shows that {iButtons} have a mean accuracy of −0.09 °C (−0.4 °C at most) with a precision of 0.05 °C (0.09 °C at most). These properties can be improved by using calibration. Due to the size of the device the response time is longer than that of conventional sensors, with a τ in water of 19 s. On the human skin under transient conditions the response time is significantly longer, revealing momentary deviations with a magnitude of 1 °C. The use of {iButtons} has been described in studies on circadian rhythms, sleep and cardiac surgery. With respect to circadian rhythm and sleep research, skin temperature assessment by {iButtons} is of significant value in laboratory, clinical and home situations. We demonstrate that differences in laboratory and field measurements add to our understanding of thermophysiology under natural living conditions. The advantage of {iButtons} in surgery research is that they are easy to sterilize and wireless so that they do not hinder the surgical procedure. In conclusion, the application of {iButtons} is advantageous for measuring skin temperatures in those situations in which wired instruments are unpractical and fast responses are not required.},

	abstract = {Skin temperature is a fundamental variable in human thermo-physiology, and yet skin temperature measurement remains impractical in most free-living, exercise and clinical settings, using currently available hard-wired methods. The purpose of this study was to compare wireless {iButtons}® and hard-wired thermistors for human skin temperature measurement. In the first of two investigations, {iButtons}® and thermistors monitored temperature in a controlled water bath (range: 10–40 °C) and were referenced against a certified, mercury thermometer. In the second investigation, eight healthy males completed three randomized trials (ambient temperature = 10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C) while both devices recorded skin temperature at rest (in low and high wind velocities) and during cycle-ergometry exercise. The results are as follows; Investigation 1: both devices displayed very high validity correlation with the reference thermometer (r {\textgreater} 0.999). Prior to correction, the mean bias was +0.121 °C for {iButtons}® and +0.045 °C for thermistors. Upon calibration correction the mean bias for {iButtons}® and thermistors was not significantly different from zero bias. Interestingly, the typical error of the estimate of {iButtons}® (0.043 °C) was 1.5 times less than that of thermistors (0.062 °C), demonstrating {iButtons}'® lower random error. Investigation 2: the offset between {iButton}® and thermistor readings was generally consistent across conditions; however, thermistor responses gave readings that were always closer to ambient temperature than those given by {iButtons}®, suggesting potential thermistor drift towards environmental conditions. Mean temperature differences between {iButtons}® and thermistors during resting trials ranged from 0.261 °C to 1.356 °C. Mean temperature differences between {iButtons}® and thermistors during exercise were 0.989 °C (ambient temperature = 10 °C), 0.415 °C (ambient temperature = 20 °C) and 0.318 °C (ambient temperature = 30 °C). Observed error estimates were within the acceptable limits for the skin temperature method comparison, with typical errors 0.9 and {CV} {\textless}1\% under all conditions. These findings indicate that wireless {iButtons}® provide a valid alternative for human skin temperature measurement during laboratory and field investigations particularly when skin temperature measurement using other currently available methods may prove problematic.},

	abstract = {Performance monitoring using wireless sensors is now common practice in building operation and maintenance and generates a large amount of building specific data. However, it is difficult for occupants, owners and operators to explore such data and understand underlying patterns. This is especially true in buildings which involve complex interactions, such as ventilation, solar gains, internal gains and thermal mass. Performance monitoring requires collecting data concerning energy consumption and ambient environmental conditions to model and optimise buildings' energy consumption. This paper details the use of data mining techniques in understanding building energy performance of geothermal, solar and gas burning energy systems. The paper is part of an outgoing research into optimisation of building performance under hybrid energy regimes. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to predict comfort levels based on the Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning ({HVAC}) system performance and external environmental conditions. A C4.5 classification methodology is used to analyse a combination of internal and external ambient conditions. The mining algorithms are used to determine comfort constraints and the influence of external conditions on a building's internal user comfort. To test the performance of classification and its use in prediction, different offices, one to the south and the other to the north of the building are used. Classification rules being developed are analysed for their application to modify control algorithms and to apply results to generalise hybrid system performance. The results of this study can be generalised for an entire building, or a set of buildings, under a single energy network subject to the same constraints.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the relationship of thermal sensations of local body segments and the whole body for a better understanding of how to estimate the overall thermal perception, as a function of partial body sensations, while considering human factors such as gender and body mass index. Thermal comfort, which can be expressed as a function of thermal dynamics between the human body and ambient thermal conditions, primarily consists of a combination of local thermal perceptions. An individual body area contributes to an overall thermal sensation at different significance levels, so that specific areas have high potential for determining the whole-body sensation. This is especially true in a typical building environment where thermal conditions are uniformly distributed and no extremely cold or hot condition occurs. For this study, a series of human subject experiments was conducted with 18 volunteers in an environmental chamber, while thermal conditions changed and thermal sensations were surveyed in the regular way. Seven local body areas were selected, based on current thermoregulation-related literature, and their local body sensations were recorded together. This study revealed that each local body sensation significantly correlated with the overall sensation, but that whole-body sensations varied for each individual body area. In addition, results of this research also suggested optimal combinations of local body areas that could represent the whole-body sensation with a high degree of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Human thermal sensation in an environment may be delayed, which may lead to life threatening conditions, such as hypothermia and hyperthermia. This is especially true for senior citizens, as aging alters the thermal perception in humans. We envision a decision support system that predicts human thermal comfort in real-time using various environmental conditions as well psychological and physiological features, and suggest corresponding actions, which can significantly improve overall thermal comfort and health of individuals, especially senior citizens. The key to realize this vision is an accurate thermal comfort model. We propose a novel machine learning based approach to learn an individual's thermal comfort model. This approach identifies the best set of features, and then learns a classifier that takes a feature vector as input and outputs a corresponding thermal sensation class (i.e. “feeling cold”, “neutral” and “feeling warm”). Evaluation using a large-scale publicly available data demonstrates that when using Support Vector Machines ({SVM}) classifiers, the accuracy of our approach is 76.7\%, over two times higher than that of the widely adopted Fanger's model (which only achieves accuracy of 35.4\%). In addition, our study indicates that two factors, a person's age and outdoor temperature that are not included in Fanger's model, play an important role in thermal comfort, which is a finding interesting in its own right.},

	abstract = {1 Time and energy are key currencies in animal ecology, and judicious management of these is a primary focus for natural selection. At present, however, there are only two main methods for estimation of rate of energy expenditure in the field, heart rate and doubly labelled water, both of which have been used with success; but both also have their limitations. 2 The deployment of data loggers that measure acceleration is emerging as a powerful tool for quantifying the behaviour of free-living animals. Given that animal movement requires the use of energy, the accelerometry technique potentially has application in the quantification of rate of energy expenditure during activity. 3 In the present study, we test the hypothesis that acceleration can serve as a proxy for rate of energy expenditure in free-living animals. We measured rate of energy expenditure as rates of O2 consumption () and {CO}2 production () in great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) at rest and during pedestrian exercise. and were then related to overall dynamic body acceleration ({ODBA}) measured with an externally attached three-axis accelerometer. 4 Both and were significantly positively associated with {ODBA} in great cormorants. This suggests that accelerometric measurements of {ODBA} can be used to estimate and and, with some additional assumptions regarding metabolic substrate use and the energy equivalence of O2 and {CO}2, that {ODBA} can be used to estimate the activity specific rate of energy expenditure of free-living cormorants. 5 To verify that the approach identifies expected trends in from situations with variable power requirements, we measured {ODBA} in free-living imperial cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) during foraging trips. We compared {ODBA} during return and outward foraging flights, when birds are expected to be laden and not laden with captured fish, respectively. We also examined changes in {ODBA} during the descent phase of diving, when power requirements are predicted to decrease with depth due to changes in buoyancy associated with compression of plumage and respiratory air. 6 In free-living imperial cormorants, {ODBA}, and hence estimated , was higher during the return flight of a foraging bout, and decreased with depth during the descent phase of a dive, supporting the use of accelerometry for the determination of activity-specific rate of energy expenditure.},

Building design frameworks have reduced these concepts to measurable parameters, such as thermal neutrality, but accumulating evidence shows this to be unsupportive of wider occupant, organizational or environmental needs. This supports calls for more adaptive standards and personal control to account for variation in human perceptions of comfort and well-being. Understanding of the socio-technical dynamics of comfort and well-being as they are negotiated and experienced in the different settings of everyday life is another relatively unexplored area of academic debate. This article reviews these different understandings of comfort and well-being and the approaches to intelligent and sustainable building practice they inspire. In conclusion, the benefits of focusing on comfort and well-being as products of socio-technical systems are discussed.},

	abstract = {The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors and past thermal history modify building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current {ASHRAE} comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the {ASHRAE} {RP}-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted means vote ({PMV}) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in {HVAC} buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.},

This paper compares the more recent data with the early patterns revealed by Humphreys' 1975–1981 analyses of the worldwide data. The comparison is made for indices of thermal comfort, mean warmth response, temperatures found to be comfortable, sensitivity to temperature change, interpersonal variation, distribution of comfort with temperature, and the influence of outdoor temperature in the presence or absence of heating and cooling. The empirical findings are compared with predictions from the predicted mean vote ({PMV}) model of comfort.

Such models frequently ignore occupants' diverse physical conditions and, therefore, have critical limitations in estimating each individual's thermal sensation levels. Since the human body is governed by the thermoregulation principle to balance the heat flux between the ambient thermal condition and the body itself, skin temperature has a significant role in maintaining this physiological principle. Therefore, this study investigated the potential use of skin temperature and its technical parameters in establishing a thermal sensation. By using advanced modern sensing technologies, and existing thermal regulation model research, this study selected and validated seven body areas as significant local body segments for determining overall thermal sensation. A series of environmental chamber tests were conducted for 2 h. While the indoor temperature fluctuated between 20 °C and 30 °C, skin temperatures of the seven selected body areas were measured in conjunction with a thermal sensation and comfort survey. Results of this study revealed that combinations of skin temperatures for the arm, back, and wrist provided the significant information needed to accurately estimate the thermal sensations of each user. Most of all, both sides of the wrist generated accurate data more than 94\% of the time. Therefore, considering the modern advanced wearable sensing technologies, results of this study confirmed that optimum combinations of skin temperature information from selected body areas, is reliable and generally applicable for estimating individual thermal sensations.},

	abstract = {The common practice of defining operational settings for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning ({HVAC}) systems in buildings is to use fixed set points, which assume occupants have same and static comfort requirements. However, thermal comfort varies from person to person and also changes due to climatic variations or acclimation, making it dynamic. In addition, thermal comfort in transient conditions are different from the steady state conditions, which makes the prediction of thermal comfort more difficult. Thus, thermal comfort has to be monitored over time. In this paper, we present a novel infrared thermography based technique to monitor an individual's thermoregulation performance and thermal comfort levels by measuring the skin temperature on several points on human face, which has a high density of blood vessels and is not usually covered by clothing. Unlike other methods, our method requires no continuous user input or interaction. Our results demonstrate that the monitored facial points behave differently under the heat and cold stresses and it can be explained based on the underlying vascular territories. We define two heuristics to describe the thermoneutral zone based on the observed behaviors and estimate thermal comfort for individuals with 95\% confidence level. Considerable variations are observed in the thermoregulation performance and uncomfortably cool conditions metrics between the males and females. Females' thermoregulation system responses are less sensitive to the perception of warm conditions. However, similar behaviors are observed for uncomfortably cool conditions across genders.},

To date, validation of energy expenditure ({EE}) predictions from accelerometers has been restricted to short laboratory or simulated free-living protocols. This study seeks to determine the capabilities of eight previously published regression equations for three commercially available accelerometers to predict summary measures of daily {EE}. Methods and Procedures: Study participants were outfitted with {ActiGraph}, Actical, and {RT}3 accelerometers, while measurements were simultaneously made during overnight stays in a room calorimeter, which provided minute-by-minute {EE} measurements, in a diverse subject population (n = 85). Regression equations for each device were used to predict the minute-by-minute metabolic equivalents ({METs}) along with the daily {PA} level ({PAL}). Results: Two {RT}3 regressions and one {ActiGraph} regression were not significantly different from calorimeter measured {PAL}. When data from the entire visit were divided into four intensity categories—sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous—significant (P {\textless} 0.001) over- and underpredictions were detected in numerous regression equations and intensity categories. Discussion: Most {EE} prediction equations showed differences of {\textless}2\% in the moderate and vigorous intensity categories. These differences, though small in magnitude, may limit the ability of these regressions to accurately characterize whether specific {PA} goals have been met in the field setting. New regression equations should be developed if more accurate prediction of the daily {PAL} or higher precision in determining the time spent in specific {PA} intensity categories is desired.},

We assessed the feasibility of wrist skin temperature monitoring for estimating subjective thermal sensation. We invented a wrist band that simultaneously monitors skin temperatures from the wrist (i.e., the radial artery and ulnar artery regions, and upper wrist) and the fingertip. Skin temperatures from eight healthy subjects were acquired while thermal sensation varied. To develop a thermal sensation estimation model, the mean skin temperature, temperature gradient, time differential of the temperatures, and average power of frequency band were calculated. A thermal sensation estimation model using temperatures of the fingertip and wrist showed the highest accuracy (mean root mean square error [{RMSE}]: 1.26 ± 0.31). An estimation model based on the three wrist skin temperatures showed a slightly better result to the model that used a single fingertip skin temperature (mean {RMSE}: 1.39 ± 0.18). When a personalized thermal sensation estimation model based on three wrist skin temperatures was used, the mean {RMSE} was 1.06 ± 0.29, and the correlation coefficient was 0.89.

	abstract = {Sensory estimates of comfort and thermal sensation for resting-sitting unclothed subjects have been compared with the associated physiological responses for the range of ambient temperatures (12°–48°C) under steady-state and transient conditions. For steady exposure to cold and warm environments, thermal comfort and neutral temperature sensations lie in the range for physiological thermal neutrality (28°–30°C), in which there is no physiological temperature regulatory effort. Discomfort increases more rapidly below 28°C than above 30°C, while thermal sensation for both heat and cold increases rapidly each side of neutral. Discomfort correlates best with lowering average skin temperature toward cold environments and with increased sweating toward hot environments. In general, discomfort is associated with a change of average body temperature from 36.5°C. The same conclusion follows for transient changes when the subject goes from comfortable to uncomfortable, neutral to cold, and neutral to warm. When these transients are reversed (i.e., cold to neutral, hot to neutral), the sensations of comfort and temperature “lead” the body temperature changes and are thus “anticipatory.” This hysteresis effect is most striking in the cold and less so for warmth. For transients from cold to warm, the rate of rise of skin temperature causes a sensation that compensates for and predominates over the sensation of discomfort caused by a low skin temperature itself. Finally, thermal discomfort is an excellent stimulus for behavioral activity by man. As a sensation, it gives man both an early and anticipatory drive for conscious action that may effect changes in his body's microclimate rather than having him depend on natural but short-term means of thermal protection—sweating, vasodilation, vasoconstriction and shivering.},

However, centralized {HVAC} systems cannot guarantee the provision of a comfortable thermal environment for everyone. Therefore, a personalized {HVAC} system that aims to adapt thermal preferences has drawn much more attention. Meanwhile, occupant-related factors like skin temperature have not had standardized measurement methods. Therefore, this paper proposes to use infrared thermography to develop individual thermal models to predict thermal sensations using three different feature sets with the random forest ({RF}) and support vector machine ({SVM}). The results have shown the correlation coefficients between clothing surface temperature and thermal sensation are 11\% and 3\% higher than those between skin temperature and thermal sensation of two subjects, respectively. With cross-validation, {SVM} with a linear kernel and penalty number of 1, as well as {RF} with 50 trees and the maximum tree depth of 3 were selected as the model configurations. As a result, the model trained with the feature set, consisting of indoor air temperature, relative humidity, skin temperature and clothing surface temperature, and with linear kernel {SVM} has achieved 100\% recall score on test data of female subjects and 95\% recall score on that of male subjects.},

Emerging wearable and smart home sensing devices offer the opportunity to develop new models of thermal comfort based on data collected in-situ. To explore this opportunity, we deployed a sensing system in seven homes and collected self-report data from 11 participants for four weeks. Our system captures many factors employed in previous thermal comfort research, as well as new factors (e.g., activity level, sweat level). Machine learning-based models derived from the collected data show improvement over previous techniques, however significant prediction errors remain. In analyzing these errors we identify six problems that pose challenges for inferring comfort in the wild. Based on our findings, we suggest techniques to improve future in-situ thermal comfort modeling efforts.},

Office temperature, relative humidity, exposed skin temperature and clothing temperature were automatically measured over approximately 27 min per subject, using remote sensors and avoiding any contact with the subjects. Thermal comfort levels were evaluated using subjects feedback, recorded every minute for the entire experiment. Clothing insulation and metabolic rate were kept relatively constant for this experiment (0.54 clo and 1.1 met). Average skin temperature was extracted from five different locations, with average temperatures of 33.5 °C, 34.5 °C, and 35.6 °C corresponding to cold discomfort, comfort and warm discomfort respectively. Average clothing temperature was also extracted from three different location, with 32.3 °C, 33.8 °C and 35.0 °C corresponding to the same three comfort levels. Relative humidity levels were similar for all subjects, with average values between 38\% and 33\%. Results showed significant correlation between observed skin temperature, clothing temperature and thermal comfort level. Also, collected data showed that the temperature difference between different body locations was highly correlated with thermal comfort, and the variance of skin temperature over a small area was significantly correlated with thermal comfort. The results suggest that non-invasive thermographic cameras that combine visual and thermal modes are sufficiently accurate in real-world settings to drive control of {HVAC} systems.},

The prediction framework described uses temperature information extracted from multiple local body parts to model an individual's thermal preference, with sensing measurements that capture local body part variance as well as differences between body parts. We compared the efficacy of using machine learning with classical measurements such as skin temperature along with our approach of using multi-part measurements and derived data. An analysis of the performance of machine learning shows that our method improved the accuracy of personal thermal comfort prediction by an average of 60\%, and the accuracy of mean time to warm discomfort prediction by an average of 40\%. The proposed thermal models were tested on subjects’ data extracted from an office setup with room temperature varying from low (21.11 °C) to high (27.78 °C). When all proposed features were used, personal thermal comfort was predicted with an accuracy higher than 80\% and mean time to warm discomfort with more than 85\% accuracy. Further analysis of the machine learning efficacy showed that temperature differences had the highest impact on performance of individual thermal preference prediction, while the proposed approach was found not sensitive to the actual machine learning algorithm.},

A positive temperature gradient (finger warmer than the forearm) of as much as 2K was seen when subjects felt warm and hot, while a negative temperature gradient (finger colder than the forearm) as much as 8.5K was seen for cool and cold subjects. A useful warm/cold boundary of 30°C was found in finger temperature, for both steady state and transient conditions. When finger temperature was above 30°C, or finger-forearm skin temperature gradient above 0K, there was no cool discomfort. When finger temperature was below 30°C, or the finger-forearm skin temperature gradient less than 0K, cool discomfort was a possibility.

At present, such systems use simple models of user comfort when deciding on a set point temperature. These models generally fail to adapt to an individual user's preferences, resulting in poor estimates of a user's preferred temperature. To address this issue, we propose a personalised thermal comfort model that uses a Bayesian network to learn and adapt to a user's individual preferences. Through an empirical evaluation based on the {ASHRAE} {RP}-884 data set, we show that our model is consistently 17.5- 23.5\% more accurate than current models, regardless of environmental conditions and the type of heating system used. Our model is not limited to a single metric but can also infer information about expected user feedback, optimal comfort temperature and thermal sensitivity at the same time, which can be used to reduce energy used for heating with minimal comfort loss.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort has become a topic issue in building performance assessment as well as energy efficiency. Three methods are mainly recognized for its assessment. Two of them based on standardized methodologies, face the problem by considering the indoor environment in steady-state conditions ({PMV} and {PPD}) and users as active subjects whose thermal perception is influenced by outdoor climatic conditions (adaptive approach). The latter method is the starting point to investigate thermal comfort from an overall perspective by considering endogenous variables besides the traditional physical and environmental ones. Following this perspective, the paper describes the results of an in-field investigation of thermal conditions through the use of nearable and wearable solutions, parametric models and machine learning techniques. The aim of the research is the exploration of the reliability of {IoT}-based solutions combined with advanced algorithms, in order to create a replicable framework for the assessment and improvement of user thermal satisfaction. For this purpose, an experimental test in real offices was carried out involving eight workers. Parametric models are applied for the assessment of thermal comfort; {IoT} solutions are used to monitor the environmental variables and the users\&rsquo; parameters; the machine learning {CART} method allows to predict the users\&rsquo; profile and the thermal comfort perception respect to the indoor environment.},

However, several studies have demonstrated that this conventional practice is unlikely to meet the thermal requirements of occupants in a single or multi-occupancy space due to occupants' diverse preferences, activities and needs. To improve occupants' thermal comfort, this study develops and tests a smartphone application framework which is capable of dynamically determining the optimum room conditioning mode (mechanical conditioning or natural ventilation) and {HVAC} settings (thermostat setpoint) in single and multi-occupancy spaces. The “personalized” {HVAC} control framework integrates environment data (obtained from sensors) with human physiological and behavioral data (obtained from wearable devices, polling apps) in a smartphone application we developed for human-building interaction. In the operation phase, occupants' thermal preferences are continuously predicted using the personalized comfort models, developed from the training data through the Random Forest classifier, when determining the optimum {HVAC} control strategies. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed framework to improve thermal comfort in single and multi-occupancy spaces.},

We developed personal thermal comfort models using lab grade wearable in normal daily activities. We collected physiological signals (e.g., skin temperature, heart rate) of 14 subjects (6 female and 8 male adults) and environmental parameters (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity) for 2–4 weeks (at least 20 h per day). Then we trained 14 models for each subject with different machine-learning algorithms to predict their thermal preference. The results show that the median prediction power could be up to 24\%/78\%/0.79 (Cohen's kappa/accuracy/{AUC}) with all features considered. The median prediction power reaches 21\%/71\%/0.7 after 200 subjective votes. We explored the importance of different features on the prediction performance by considering all subjects in one dataset. When all features included for the entire dataset, personal comfort models can generate the highest performance of 35\%/76\%/0.80 by the most predictive algorithm. Personal comfort models display the highest prediction power when occupants' thermal sensations is outside thermal neutrality. Skin temperature measured at the ankle is more predictive than measured at the wrist. We suggest that Cohen's kappa or {AUC} should be employed to assess the performance of personal thermal comfort models for imbalanced datasets due to the capacity to exclude random success.},

	abstract = {{HVAC} systems are the major energy consumers in commercial buildings in the United States. These systems are operated to provide comfortable thermal conditions for building occupants. The common practice of defining operational settings for {HVAC} systems is to use fixed set points, which assume occupants have static comfort requirements. However, thermal comfort has been shown to vary from person to person and also change over time due to climatic variations or acclimation. In this paper, we introduce an online learning approach for modeling and quantifying personalized thermal comfort. In this approach, we fit a probability distribution to each comfort condition (i.e., uncomfortably warm, comfortable, and uncomfortably cool) data set and define the overall comfort of an individual through combing these distributions in a Bayesian network. In order to identify comfort variations over time, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is used on the joint probability distributions. In order to identify comfortable environmental conditions, a Bayesian optimal classifier is trained using online learning. In order to validate the approach, we collected data from 33 subjects, and an average accuracy of 70.14\% and specificity of 76.74\% were achieved. In practice, this approach could transform the comfort objectives to constrain functions and prevents pareto optimality problems.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort is a personal assessment of one's satisfaction with the surroundings. Yet, most thermal comfort delivery mechanisms preclude physiological and psychological precursors to thermal comfort. Accordingly, many people feel either cold or hot in an environment that is supposedly thermally comfortable to most people. To address this issue, this paper proposes to use people's heart rate variability ({HRV}) as an alternative indicator of thermal comfort. Since {HRV} is linked to homeostasis, we hypothesize that it could be used to predict people's thermal comfort status. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed statistical, spectral, and nonlinear {HRV} indices of 17 human subjects doing light office work in a cold, a neutral, and a hot environment. The resulting {HRV} indices were used as inputs to machine learning classification algorithms. We observed that {HRV} is distinctively altered depending on the thermal environment and that it is possible to steadfastly predict each subject's thermal environment (cold, neutral, and hot) with up to a 93.7\% prediction accuracy. The result of this study implies that it could be possible to design automatic real-time thermal comfort controllers based on people's {HRV}.},

However, securing consistent occupant feedback for model development is challenging as the current methods of data collection rely on individuals' survey participation. We explored the use of a new type of feedback, occupants' heating and cooling behavior with a personal comfort system ({PCS}) for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals' thermal preference. The model development draws from field data including {PCS} control behavior, environmental conditions and mechanical system settings collected from 38 occupants in an office building, and employs six machine learning algorithms. The results showed that (1) personal comfort models based on all field data produced the median accuracy of 0.73 among all subjects and improved predictive accuracy compared to conventional models ({PMV}, adaptive) which produced a median accuracy of 0.51; (2) the {PMV} and adaptive models produced individual comfort predictions only slightly better than random guessing under the relatively mild indoor environment observed in the field study; and (3) the models based on {PCS} control behavior produced the best prediction accuracy when individually assessing all categories of field data acquired in the study. We conclude that personal comfort models based on occupants' heating and cooling behavior can effectively predict individuals' thermal preference and can therefore be used in everyday comfort management to improve occupant satisfaction and energy use in buildings.},

We critically review evidence for direct associations between these aspects of indoor environmental quality ({IEQ}) and performance or attendance. Secondarily, we summarize, without critique, evidence on indirect connections potentially linking {IEQ} to performance or attendance. Regarding direct associations, little strongly designed research was available. Persuasive evidence links higher indoor concentrations of {NO}(2) to reduced school attendance, and suggestive evidence links low ventilation rates to reduced performance. Regarding indirect associations, many studies link indoor dampness and microbiologic pollutants (primarily in homes) to asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections, which in turn have been related to reduced performance and attendance. Also, much evidence links poor {IEQ} (e.g. low ventilation rate, excess moisture, or formaldehyde) with adverse health effects in children and adults and documents dampness problems and inadequate ventilation as common in schools. Overall, evidence suggests that poor {IEQ} in schools is common and adversely influences the performance and attendance of students, primarily through health effects from indoor pollutants. Evidence is available to justify (i) immediate actions to assess and improve {IEQ} in schools and (ii) focused research to guide {IEQ} improvements in schools.
{PRACTICAL} {IMPLICATIONS}: There is more justification now for improving {IEQ} in schools to reduce health risks to students than to reduce performance or attendance risks. However, as {IEQ}-performance links are likely to operate largely through effects of {IEQ} on health, {IEQ} improvements that benefit the health of students are likely to have performance and attendance benefits as well. Immediate actions are warranted in schools to prevent dampness problems, inadequate ventilation, and excess indoor exposures to substances such as {NO}(2) and formaldehyde. Also, siting of new schools in areas with lower outdoor pollutant levels is preferable.},

This supports calls for more adaptive standards and personal control to account for variation in human perceptions of comfort and well-being. Understanding of the socio-technical dynamics of comfort and well-being as they are negotiated and experienced in the different settings of everyday life is another relatively unexplored area of academic debate.

Recruited subjects performed neurobehavioural tests examining different component skills, and addition and typing tasks that were used to replicate office work. The results show that thermal discomfort caused by elevated air temperature had a negative effect on performance. A quantitative relationship was established between thermal sensation votes and task performance. It can be used for economic calculations pertaining to building design and operation when occupant productivity is considered. The relationship indicates that optimum performance can be achieved slightly below neutral, while thermal discomfort (feeling too warm or too cold) leads to reduced performance. Consequently, it makes sense to set the {PMV} limits in workplaces in the range between −0.5 and 0 instead of between −0.5 and 0.5 as stipulated in the present standards.},

Tools to inform strategies directed at dealing with cold homes and fuel poverty are considered, including Energy Performance Certificates, Fuel Poverty Indicators, and the English Housing Health and Safety Rating System. Conclusions from a {WHO} Workshop on Housing, Energy and Thermal Comfort are also summarised. The {WHO} view of thermal comfort, which is driven by protecting health from both high and low indoor temperatures, should be recognised in energy efficiency, fuel poverty and climate change strategies.

This paper discusses two implementations of the adaptive comfort model in terms of usability and energy use for moderate maritime climate zones by means of literature study, a case study comprising temperature measurements, and building performance simulation. It is concluded that for moderate climate zones the adaptive model is only applicable during summer months, and can reduce energy for naturally conditioned buildings. However, the adaptive thermal comfort model has very limited application potential for such climates. Additionally we suggest a temperature parameter with a gradual course to replace the mean monthly outdoor air temperature to avoid step changes in optimum comfort temperatures.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort models - specifically the J.B. Pierce two-node model of human thermoregulation and the Fanger Comfort Equation - predict comfort responses of individuals exposed to thermal environments under conditions of either rest or exercise. This paper evaluates the ability of these two models to predict the physiological variables underlying thermal comfort over a wide range of still air environments (effective temperature between 5°C and 45°C) and exercise intensities (rest to 85\% of maximal aerobic capacity). The physiological data base used for comparison was taken from several published and as-yet unpublished studies at three different laboratories. Values of core temperature ({TCR}), skin temperature ({TSK}) and skin wettedness predicted by the Pierce two-node model, and {PMV}, predicted by the Fanger model, differed significantly from observed values (P{\textless}.05). The Pierce model tended to underestimate w (mean error = -.16) and {TCR} (mean error = -.31°C), and to overpredict {TSK} (mean error = .48°C). wettedness predictions were less accurate for high exercise intensity (6 to 8 met) than for rest, low exercise intensity (i to 3.5 met) or moderate exercise intensity (3.5 to 6 met). Accuracy was higher for males than females, and greater for females in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle than females in the luteal phase. Errors in {TSK} predictions were also associated with exercise intensity but not associated with either gender or effective temperature. {TCR} predictions were significantly more accurate for females than for males. The average error associated with {PMV} predictions was 1.26 scaling units and was related to both effective temperature ({ET}*) and exercise intensity. Based on multiple linear regression with and exercise intensity, the expected error in {PMV} was approximately zero at {ET}=28°C for resting subjects. The magnitude of error increased by approximately .3 scaling units for each l°C change in {ET}, and by approximately 1.3 scaling units for each increase in exercise intensity level (e.g. rest to low).},

This discrepancy is larger for cool outdoor conditions than for warm ones. For example, for a person leaving a room in thermal comfort (Tsk=33.5°C, Tcore=37 °C) into cold winter outdoor conditions (Ta=Tmrt=0°C, {VP}=5hPa, v=1m/s) obtaining steady state will take many hours, while leaving into hot conditions (Ta=30°C, Tmrt=60°C, {VP}=15hPa, v=0.5m/s) it will be reached within less than 30min. Consequently, especially for outdoor thermal comfort assessments in cold conditions, non-steady state models should be applied. This, among other new aspects, will be considered in a new internationally standardised Universal Thermal Climate Index ({UTCI}), which is currently being developed by a working group of the International Society of Biometeorology. Besides such physical/physiological approaches, psychological factors also have to be considered, i.e. diverging thermal expectations indoors and outdoors.

	abstract = {In recent years, adaptive thermal comfort models have been integrated into several building design and operations regulatory documents. Although the theoretical background of the adaptive thermal comfort models is quite mature, still some ambiguities exist for their application. The objective of this study is to identify the main sources of uncertainty around application of adaptive models and to analyze quantitatively the difference between the adaptive comfort models proposed by the regulatory documents when applied across a spectrum of different climate zones. This paper analyzes the adaptive models in {ASHRAE} Standard 55, the European {EN} 15251 (and its revision {prEN} 16798), the Dutch {ISSO} 74 and the Chinese {GB}/T 50785. For each regulatory document, the major variations or sources of uncertainty are investigated: for {ASHRAE} 55, the length of the calculation period of the prevailing mean of outdoor temperature, and for {EN} 15251, {prEN} 16798, and {GB}/T 50785, the exponential decay weighting factors used in the calculation of the running mean outdoor temperature. This study shows that, although these regulatory documents have promoted the uptake of adaptive comfort models by practitioners and designers, uncertainties surrounding their application obstruct full exploitation. In response, this paper offers a fine-tuning of some of the adaptive comfort models. However, the issue of adaptive models' applicability in hybrid ventilation or mixed-mode buildings is still to be resolved, as is a rational basis for identifying the operational mode of such buildings when the adaptive models can be applied, because of their intermittent compliance during transition seasons and also extreme weather events.},

	abstract = {Energy consumption of residential buildings and offices adds up to about 30\% of total carbon dioxide emissions; and occupant behaviour contributes to 80\% of the variation in energy consumption1. Indoor climate regulations are based on an empirical thermal comfort model that was developed in the 1960s (ref. 2). Standard values for one of its primary variables—metabolic rate—are based on an average male, and may overestimate female metabolic rate by up to 35\% (ref. 3). This may cause buildings to be intrinsically non-energy-efficient in providing comfort to females. Therefore, we make a case to use actual metabolic rates. Moreover, with a biophysical analysis we illustrate the effect of miscalculating metabolic rate on female thermal demand. The approach is fundamentally different from current empirical thermal comfort models and builds up predictions from the physical and physiological constraints, rather than statistical association to thermal comfort. It provides a substantiation of the thermal comfort standard on the population level and adds flexibility to predict thermal demand of subpopulations and individuals. Ultimately, an accurate representation of thermal demand of all occupants leads to actual energy consumption predictions and real energy savings of buildings that are designed and operated by the buildings services community.},

A simple web-based interface to the database enables filtering on multiple criteria, including building typology, occupancy type, subjects' demographic variables, subjective thermal comfort states, indoor thermal environmental criteria, calculated comfort indices, environmental control criteria and outdoor meteorological information.

	abstract = {Building occupants' perception of thermal comfort can be influenced by a number of contextual factors, such as their demographic and anthropometric characteristics, behavioural patterns and cultural aspects. The objective of this work is to investigate the relationship between various contextual factors and the perception of thermal comfort in workplaces, by examining the gap between the current thermal comfort criteria and the actual requirements observed for different groups of occupants. The classic thermal comfort field research design i.e. simultaneous measurements of physical environmental parameters and questionnaire surveys, was implemented for two years in both centralised {HVAC} and mixed-mode office buildings located in Southern Brazil. Over 7500 questionnaires were completed by occupants of the buildings. Key variables including the participants' gender, age, body mass index, prior exposure to air-conditioning and building ventilation type were investigated in order to identify their association with thermal discomfort in the office workplace. Our results suggest that males, overweight occupants and those who are more frequently exposed to air-conditioning are more likely to express thermal discomfort due to feeling ‘warm’, compared to females, non-overweight occupants and those who were exposed to air-conditioning less frequently. In comparison, females, non-overweight occupants, air-conditioning light users, and occupants of centralised {HVAC} buildings were more likely to declare ‘cold’ discomfort. We also investigated how those variables were related to the width of thermal comfort zone. The analysis indicates that different groups of occupants require different comfort zones, suggesting that group differences should be considered when designing/operating spaces for diverse groups of occupants.},

There was no significant difference of clothing insulation for male and female subjects. Significant differences were found for thermal sensation, thermal preference, thermal acceptability and thermal comfort in the central air-conditioned building. In mixed-mode buildings, significant differences were found for thermal sensation and thermal preference responses of male and female subjects. However, during air-conditioning operation in mixed-mode buildings, significant differences were found for thermal preference and thermal acceptability responses of male and female subjects; and during natural ventilation operation, significant differences were found for thermal sensation and thermal preference. In contrast to what some previous studies have found this work indicates the existence of significant differences in the thermal comfort responses of male and female subjects.},

Thus, 116 field studies were performed from March 2014 to March 2016 involving 584 participants in two office buildings. In order to collect temperature, relative humidity and air velocity data, microclimate stations were installed in the offices. Data collected were submitted to statistical analysis: they were initially separated according to the type of building (mixed-mode or fully air-conditioned) and operating system, and then they were distributed according to gender. The comfort temperatures were estimated by means of linear regression and by using the Griffiths method. Results show that the Griffiths method is more suitable to express the comfort temperature for men and women. Overall, the comfort temperature was 24.0 °C for females, and 23.2 °C for males. In the mixed-mode building, comfort temperature was statistically higher for females than that for males (23.7 °C and 23.0 °C, respectively). In the fully air-conditioned building, significant differences were found for comfort temperature for females and males (24.2 °C and 23.4 °C, respectively). Furthermore, when the mixed-mode building operated under natural ventilation the comfort temperatures tended to be lower for both men and women when compared to the comfort temperature found in the same building during air-conditioning operation.},

There exist, however, underlying biases in relation to all contributing variables, and a further bias related to the outdoor temperature. These biases often combine to produce a substantial bias in {PMV}. In surveys of individual buildings, {PMV} often differs markedly and systematically from the actual mean vote, both for naturally ventilated ({NV}) and for air-conditioned ({AC}) spaces. Possible origins of the biases are discussed, and it is shown that it would be possible to modify {PMV} substantially to reduce them. Environmental consequences of the use of {PMV} are discussed. It is concluded that {ISO} 7730 in its present form can be seriously misleading when used to estimate thermal comfort conditions in buildings.},

Significant correlations were detected between {UTCI} and other heat indices ({SET}, {PET}, {PMV}, and {WBGT}). {UTCI} also was measurably correlated with environmental parameters like dry temperature (P {\textless} 0.0001). The highest correlation coefficient was observed between {UTCI} and {PET} (r = 0.96). {UTCI} also had strong correlations with {WBGT} (r = 0.88), {SET} (r = 0.87), and dry temperature (r = 0.90). Thus, indices that are calculated based on body thermal equation (i.e. {SET} and {PET}) are more strongly connected with {UTCI}, registering a better slope.

The subject was directed to adjust the Ta for 45 min by manipulating a remote control switch to the level at which he felt most comfortable. In the older group, the Tpref was significantly lower in trails starting at 20 degrees C than that starting at 40 degrees C in summer. The fluctuation of Tpref (temperature difference between maximum and minimum Ta during the last 10 min) was significantly wider in the older group in both summer and winter. Repetition of the same experiment on each subject showed a poorer reproducibility of Tpref in the older group than in the younger group in summer. Tympanic and esophageal temperatures of the older group kept falling throughout the trial starting at 20 degrees C in summer. These results suggest that thermal sensitivity is decreased with advancing age and that thermal perception in the elderly, especially to cold, is less sensitive in summer.},

	abstract = {In the assessment of thermal comfort in buildings, the use of the Predicted Mean Vote ({PMV}) model is very popular. For this model, data on the climate, on clothing and on metabolic heat production are required. This paper discusses the representation and measurement of clothing parameters and metabolic rate in the {PMV} context. Several problems are identified and for some of these solutions are provided. For clothing insulation it was shown that effects of body motion and air movement are so big that they must be accounted for in comfort prediction models to be physically accurate. However, effects on dry heat exchange are small for stationary, light work at low air movement. Also algorithms for convective heat exchange in prediction models should be reconsidered. For evaporative heat resistance of the clothing worn, which is currently not an input factor in the {PMV} model, it was shown that in cases where special clothing with high vapour resistance is worn (e.g. clean-room clothing), comfort may be limited by the clothing as it will induce a high skin wettedness. Thus, for such cases clothing vapour resistance should not be neglected in the calculation of comfort using the {PMV} model, or the induced skin wettedness should be calculated separately. The effects on thermal comfort of reductions in vapour resistance due to air and body movements are also shown to have a substantial impact on the comfort limits in terms of skin wettedness and cannot be neglected either. For metabolic heat production it was concluded that for precise comfort assessment a precise measure of metabolic rate is needed. In order to improve metabolic rate estimation based on {ISO} 8996, more data and detail is needed for activities with a metabolic rate below 2 {MET}. Finally, it was shown that the methods for determining metabolic rate provided in {ISO} 8996 (typically used in comfort assessment and evaluations) do not provide sufficient accuracy to allow determination of comfort (expressed as {PMV}) in sufficient precision to classify buildings to within 0.3 {PMV} units as proposed in the upcoming revision of {ISO} 7730.},

It leverages the Internet of Things and machine learning to learn individuals' comfort requirements directly from the data collected in their everyday environment. Its results could be aggregated to predict comfort of a population. To provide guidance on future efforts in this emerging research area, this paper presents a unified framework for personal comfort models. We first define the problem by providing a brief discussion of existing thermal comfort models and their limitations for real-world applications, and then review the current state of research on personal comfort models including a summary of key advances and gaps. We then describe a modeling framework to establish fundamental concepts and methodologies for developing and evaluating personal comfort models, followed by a discussion of how such models can be integrated into indoor environmental controls. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for applications of personal comfort models for building design, control, standards, and future research.},

This was done by having healthy volunteers wear both the Empatica E4 and the clinician standard device while following standard clinician procedure for atrial fibrillation diagnosis. The device was compared qualitatively against General Electric's {SEER} Light Extend Recorder holter portable electrocardiogram. The analysis was done by non-experts at varying academic levels.

	abstract = {Dans la présente analyse, nous avons évalué la validité de deux modèles de confort thermiques couramment utilisés. Le premier, le modèle de Fanger de vote moyen prévisible (indice {PMV}), combine quatre variables physiques (température de l'air, vitesse de l'air, température moyenne radiante et humidité relative) et deux variables personnelles (isolation par les vêtements et niveau d'activité) pour obtenir un indice qui peut servir à prédire la sensation thermique moyenne d'un grand groupe de personnes. Le second, le modèle de prédiction des courants d'air, prédit le pourcentage d'occupants qui pourrait se plaindre de courants d'air localisés à partir de trois variables physiques (température de l'air, vitesse moyenne de l'air et intensité de la turbulence). Notre analyse a indiqué que le modèle {PMV} n'est pas toujours un bon prédicteur de la sensation thermique réelle, en particulier dans le cadre des études sur le terrain. Les divergences entre les sensations thermiques prédites et réelles traduisaient en partie les difficultés liées à l'obtention de mesures précises pour l'isolation par les vêtements et le niveau d'activité. Dans la pratique, une mauvaise estimation de ces deux variables tend à réduire la précision des prédictions {PMV}. Notre analyse a également fait ressortir que l'erreur systématique des prédictions {PMV} variait selon le contexte. Le modèle générait de meilleures prédictions dans les bâtiments climatisés que dans ceux qui recevaient une ventilation naturelle, en partie à cause de l'influence de la température de l'air extérieur et des possibilités d'adaptation.},

	abstract = {Designing and constructing near zero energy buildings ({NZEBs}) is a challenge not only from a structural point of view, but also from the point of view of ensuring appropriate climate comfort for users. The standards describing how to ensure comfort were created in times when the challenges of building {ZEB}/{NZEB} were not yet explored and energy issues were not as important as they are today. Therefore, the assessment of the thermal and climatic comfort of people living and working in such buildings requires a new or revised approach to the methodology of thermal comfort assessment. In this article, the authors present the results of a thermal comfort study based on measurements and thermal sensory tests. Testing was carried out in an experimental oﬃce building (passive standard). The main goal of the experiment was to compare the thermal comfort measurement method based on the {ISO}-Fanger model with the actual comfort results obtained by the panellists in the model oﬃce condition. The tests allowed the lowest operating temperature providing thermal comfort (predicted mean vote ({PMV}) = 0 and −0.5) to be determined. Sensory tests were conducted using three types of questions. The results were compared to the other researchers’ ﬁndings. It was noted that the panellists showed better thermal comfort sensation at lower temperatures than would result from the traditional Fanger distribution, so the authors proposed the experimental function of percentage of dissatisﬁed ({PPD}) = f({PMV}). The authors hope that it contributed to the actual state of knowledge as a “small and speciﬁc scale” validation of the existing thermal comfort model. The results also revealed that the method of heating has an inﬂuence on the subjective thermal sensation.},

However, a large performance gap may not necessarily mean that there are flaws in the building or deviations from the intended design. The causes for the performance gap can be analysed by calibrating the simulation model to measured data. In this paper, an approach is introduced for verifying compliance with energy performance criteria of residential buildings. The approach is based on a performance gap analysis that takes the uncertainties in the energy evaluation methods into consideration. The scope is to verify building energy performance through simulation and analysis of measured data, identifying any performance gap due to deviations from the intended design or flaws in the finished building based on performance gap analysis. In the approach, a simulation model is calibrated to match the heat loss coefficient of the building envelope [{kWh}/K] instead of the measured energy. The introduced approach is illustrated using a single-family residential building. The heat loss coefficient was found useful towards identifying any deviations from the intended design or flaws in the finished building. The case study indicated that the method uncertainty was important to consider in the performance gap analysis and that the proposed approach is applicable even when the performance gap appears to be non-existing.},

	abstract = {Mean Radiant Temperature ({MRT}) is an important factor of Fanger's {PMV} model, which is the most popular method to study human thermal comfort. However, it has often been a practice to assume {MRT} equal to air temperature (Ta) during indoor thermal studies. In this paper, we have studied the consequences of this simplistic assumption on the thermal comfort of occupants in air-conditioned buildings. A worldwide database of about 10000 occupants covering 9 climatic zones and 4 seasons has been studied. The effect on comfort indices-Predicted Mean Vote ({PMV}), Actual Mean Vote ({AMV}), Thermal Acceptability Vote ({TSA}) and Thermal Preference Vote ({MCI}) are presented. It is observed that even a small difference in Ta and {MRT} can lead to significant error in determination of thermal comfort. A correlation study between {AMV} and the six Macpherson factors reveals that {MRT} has the highest positive correlation with the thermal sensation reported by the occupants. Study of {TSA} and {MCI} show that the assumption is more likely to affect comfort level determination in the uncomfortable range.},

This paper investigates the simplification of past studies that the Tmrt is equal to the air temperature (Ta) under indoor conditions. In a second step, the causes for deviations between the two parameters are examined and integrated into the context of indoor climate. Measurements were conducted in four rooms at the Geography Department of Humboldt University in Berlin during autochthonal weather conditions from the 16th of August to the 2nd of September 2013. Tmrt was derived using integral radiation measurements and three different types of globe thermometers. The study indicates that the deviations between the different methods of obtaining Tmrt are negligible for indoor environments. The results show that the differences between Ta and Tmrt are negligible during most periods, as stated in previous literature. As air temperatures increase, however, Tmrt exceeds Ta up to 1.3 K. The examination of the surface temperatures indicates that rooms with window walls facing southeast and southwest show the largest disparities between Ta and Tmrt. The correlation between Ta and Tmrt and the sum of the short and long wave radiation specifies the radiation intensity and duration as the main driver of Tmrt. Future studies on indoor heat stress should hence consider that Tmrt and Ta can differ depending on the characteristics of the room and on solar radiation.},

The standard (and index) has validity, reliability and usability. It is limited in application by consideration of estimating metabolic heat and the effects of clothing. Use of the standard also requires interpretation in terms of how it is used. Management systems, involving risk assessments, that take account of context and culture, are required to ensure successful use of the standard and global applicability. For use outdoors, a {WBGT} equation that includes solar absorptivity is recommended. A ‘clothed {WBGT} ’ is proposed to account for the effects of clothing.

	abstract = {Because humans spend most of their time indoors and can be negatively affected by unfavourable thermal environ­ments, the assessment of indoor heat stress is an important issue for public health care. To characterise indoor human bioclimate, the Universal Thermal Climate Index ({UTCI}) was used. {UTCI} values were calculated from meas­urements of air temperature and air humidity in 16 rooms in Berlin during the summer months of 2011 and 2012. A constant air velocity of approximately 0.3 m/s and a metabolic heat production of 135 W/m2 were assumed. The mean radiant temperature was set to the air temperature. Because the mean air humidity was below or slightly above 50 \%, the calculated {UTCI} values were mostly lower than the air temperatures. In summer 2012, the mean {UTCI} values ranged from 22.2 °C to 27.1 °C, and the maximum {UTCI} values ranged from 24.7 °C to 35.6 °C. Whereas only minor differences were found between rooms located within comparable buildings in different districts of Berlin, pronounced variations of the {UTCI} values were detected in two adjoining buildings, with differences up to 8.6 K for the daily minimum, 9.8 K for the daily mean and 12.2 K for the daily maximum {UTCI} between differ­ent rooms. These variations can be explained by differences in the structures of the two buildings, floor level and aspect. The {UTCI} values were also used to determine the occurrence of moderate and strong heat stress. Only two rooms showed no thermal stress, while strong heat stress was detected in three rooms.},

	abstract = {Existing procedures for the assessment of the thermal environment in the fields of public weather services, public health systems, precautionary planning, urban design, tourism and recreation and climate impact research exhibit significant shortcomings. This is most evident for simple (mostly two-parameter) indices, when comparing them to complete heat budget models developed since the 1960s. {ISB} Commission 6 took up the idea of developing a Universal Thermal Climate Index ({UTCI}) based on the most advanced multi-node model of thermoregulation representing progress in science within the last three to four decades, both in thermo-physiological and heat exchange theory. Creating the essential research synergies for the development of {UTCI} required pooling the resources of multidisciplinary experts in the fields of thermal physiology, mathematical modelling, occupational medicine, meteorological data handling (in particular radiation modelling) and application development in a network. It was possible to extend the expertise of {ISB} Commission 6 substantially by {COST} (a European programme promoting Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action 730 so that finally over 45 scientists from 23 countries (Australia, Canada, Israel, several Europe countries, New Zealand, and the United States) worked together. The work was performed under the umbrella of the {WMO} Commission on Climatology ({CCl}). After extensive evaluations, Fiala’s multi-node human physiology and thermal comfort model ({FPC}) was adopted for this study. The model was validated extensively, applying as yet unused data from other research groups, and extended for the purposes of the project. This model was coupled with a state-of-the-art clothing model taking into consideration behavioural adaptation of clothing insulation by the general urban population in response to actual environmental temperature. {UTCI} was then derived conceptually as an equivalent temperature ({ET}). Thus, for any combination of air temperature, wind, radiation, and humidity (stress), {UTCI} is defined as the isothermal air temperature of the reference condition that would elicit the same dynamic response (strain) of the physiological model. As {UTCI} is based on contemporary science its use will standardise applications in the major fields of human biometeorology, thus making research results comparable and physiologically relevant.},

	abstract = {The Perceived Temperature ({PT}) is an equivalent temperature based on a complete heat budget model of the human body. It has proved its suitability for numerous applications across a wide variety of scales from micro to global and is successfully used both in daily forecasts and climatological studies. {PT} is designed for staying outdoors and is defined as the air temperature of a reference environment in which the thermal perception would be the same as in the actual environment. The calculation is performed for a reference subject with an internal heat production of 135 W m−2 (who is walking at 4 km h−1 on flat ground). In the reference environment, the mean radiant temperature equals the air temperature and wind velocity is reduced to a slight draught. The water vapour pressure remains unchanged. Under warm/humid conditions, however, it is implicitly related to a relative humidity of 50\%. Clothing is adapted in order to achieve thermal comfort. If this is impossible, cold or heat stress will occur, respectively. The assessment of thermal perception by means of {PT} is based on Fanger’s Predicted Mean Vote ({PMV}) together with additional model extensions taking account of stronger deviations from thermal neutrality. This is performed using a parameterisation based on a two-node model. In the cold, it allows the mean skin temperature to drop below the comfort value. In the heat, it assesses additionally the enthalpy of sweat-moistened skin and of wet clothes. {PT} has the advantages of being self-explanatory due to its deviation from air temperature and being—via {PMV}—directly linked to a thermo-physiologically-based scale of thermal perception that is widely used and has stood the test of time. This paper explains in detail the basic equations of the human heat budget and the coefficients of the parameterisations.},

	abstract = {With considerably increased coverage of weather information in the news media in recent years in many countries, there is also more demand for data that are applicable and useful for everyday life. Both the perception of the thermal component of weather as well as the appropriate clothing for thermal comfort result from the integral effects of all meteorological parameters relevant for heat exchange between the body and its environment. Regulatory physiological processes can affect the relative importance of meteorological parameters, e.g. wind velocity becomes more important when the body is sweating. In order to take into account all these factors, it is necessary to use a heat-balance model of the human body. The physiological equivalent temperature ({PET}) is based on the Munich Energy-balance Model for Individuals ({MEMI}), which models the thermal conditions of the human body in a physiologically relevant way. {PET} is defined as the air temperature at which, in a typical indoor setting (without wind and solar radiation), the heat budget of the human body is balanced with the same core and skin temperature as under the complex outdoor conditions to be assessed. This way {PET} enables a layperson to compare the integral effects of complex thermal conditions outside with his or her own experience indoors. On hot summer days, for example, with direct solar irradiation the {PET} value may be more than 20 K higher than the air temperature, on a windy day in winter up to 15 K lower.},

This paper deals with a critical review on the typical measurement methodologies combined with a comparative analysis of the metrological performances exhibited by the more common practice instruments on the market. To this purpose a special room-test has been designed aiming to reproduce the typical microclimatic conditions can be encountered in workplaces both in summer and in winter conditions. The effect of the measurement methodology and used instruments on the thermal comfort (global and local) and the thermal stress assessment has been finally discussed. Obtained results show that the use of different instruments consistent with {ISO} Standard 7726 requirements results in values of the mean radiant temperature compatible with each other, but the consequences on thermal environment assessment appear often ambiguous. Obtained results have focused the need for starting an in-depth discussion on the measurements’ protocols and the instruments leading to a possible reduction of the required accuracy levels reported in the {ISO} Standard 7726.},

	abstract = {The mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is one of the most important meteorological parameters governing human energy balance. In this paper, three different methods of obtaining the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting are compared. Method A is based on integral radiation measurements and angular factors, method B is based on measurements with a 38-mm flat grey globe thermometer and in method C makes use of the Rayman 1.2 software is used. Measurements were performed in a large open square in a high latitude city—Göteborg, Sweden—during clear to overcast weather conditions in October 2005 and in July and August 2006. Results show that the difference between Method A and Method B was generally relatively small. Most of the discrepancy, caused by rapid changes in radiation, temperature and wind speed was smoothed out using 5 min mean values. By systematically and empirically changing the mean convection coefficient, the accuracy of Method B was improved and a new equation expressing the Tmrt was obtained. With this new equation the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer could successfully be used to estimate the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting provided that the wind speed and the air and globe temperatures are measured accurately. The study also shows that the flat grey colour of the globe thermometer slightly underestimates the level of short-wave radiation (i.e. sunshine). Method C works very well during the middle of the day in July, i.e. at high sun elevations. However, the model considerably underestimates the Tmrt in the morning and evening in July and during the whole day in October, i.e. at low sun elevations. In outdoor urban settings where thermal comfort researchers or urban planners and designers require an easy and reliable method of estimating mean radiant temperature, the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer provides a good and cheap solution.

Meteorological information is provided by the station as current 10-min mean values and 10-min totals of precipitation, respectively.},

	shorttitle = {Indoor heat stress},
	abstract = {Because humans spend most of their time indoors and can be negatively affected by unfavourable thermal environ­ments, the assessment of indoor heat stress is an important issue for public health care. To characterise indoor human bioclimate, the Universal Thermal Climate Index ({UTCI}) was used. {UTCI} values were calculated from meas­urements of air temperature and air humidity in 16 rooms in Berlin during the summer months of 2011 and 2012. A constant air velocity of approximately 0.3 m/s and a metabolic heat production of 135 W/m2 were assumed. The mean radiant temperature was set to the air temperature. Because the mean air humidity was below or slightly above 50 \%, the calculated {UTCI} values were mostly lower than the air temperatures. In summer 2012, the mean {UTCI} values ranged from 22.2 °C to 27.1 °C, and the maximum {UTCI} values ranged from 24.7 °C to 35.6 °C. Whereas only minor differences were found between rooms located within comparable buildings in different districts of Berlin, pronounced variations of the {UTCI} values were detected in two adjoining buildings, with differences up to 8.6 K for the daily minimum, 9.8 K for the daily mean and 12.2 K for the daily maximum {UTCI} between differ­ent rooms. These variations can be explained by differences in the structures of the two buildings, floor level and aspect. The {UTCI} values were also used to determine the occurrence of moderate and strong heat stress. Only two rooms showed no thermal stress, while strong heat stress was detected in three rooms.},

	abstract = {Few environmental factors have a larger influence on animal energetics than temperature, a fact that makes thermoregulation a very important process for survival. In general, endothermic species, i.e., mammals and birds, maintain a constant body temperature (Tb) in fluctuating environmental temperatures using autonomic and behavioural mechanisms. Most of the knowledge on thermoregulatory physiology has emerged from studies using mammalian species, particularly rats. However, studies with all vertebrate groups are essential for a more complete understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Tb. Ectothermic vertebrates–fish, amphibians and reptiles–thermoregulate essentially by behavioural mechanisms. With few exceptions, both endotherms and ectotherms develop fever (a regulated increase in Tb) in response to exogenous pyrogens, and regulated hypothermia (anapyrexia) in response to hypoxia. This review focuses on the mechanisms, particularly neuromediators and regions in the central nervous system, involved in thermoregulation in vertebrates, in conditions of euthermia, fever and anapyrexia.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study is to propose a new model for predicting thermal sensation in the non-steady state based on skin temperature and its time differential. A multiple regression equation for the prediction of the transient thermal sensation as a function of mean skin temperature and its time differential is determined based on the data obtained in subject experiments involving various non-steady state patterns during sedentary conditions. The results indicate a high correlation and a trend in good agreement between the predicted and experimental thermal sensations in a non-steady state, and showed that the proposed equation can predict transient whole-body thermal sensation with high precision. In addition, experiments incorporating processes with changes in metabolic rate (walking) were conducted on the subjects, and the applicability of the proposed equation, which was based on the data for sedentary conditions, to the conditions involving such a change in metabolic rate was studied. When the skin temperatures of all the body segments increase or decrease simultaneously, the predicted thermal sensation agrees well with the experimental results, allowing for the use of the proposed equation, while the application of the equation is more difficult for the cases in which skin temperature increases and decreases coexist over the segments of the body.},

	abstract = {Indoor thermal comfort is the most commonly studied type of comfort in the literature. We can find works which try to predict the user's satisfaction or keep static conditions by means of black-box controllers. However, we propose a novel system which is capable of adapting to the user's thermal preferences without any prior knowledge, and measuring his comfort level by aggregating several thermal parameters into one single thermal index. This single value is used in a static set of fuzzy rules easily understood by the user, and the labels used in those rules are dynamically adapted to the estimated preferences of the user. Experimental simulation shows that our proposal is capable of learning on-line the optimal thermal feeling for the user, and anticipating the necessary actions to obtain such thermal comfort in an indoor environment. The ubiquitous nature of nodes in a Wireless Sensor Networks ({WSN}) opens up wide possibilities for combining its distributed sensing power with advanced adaptive real-time learning systems. Thus, this paper also presents a proposal of integration of a thermal comfort adaptive fuzzy system into Coral2K®, a centralized platform for monitoring and control heterogeneous {WSN} networks.},
